You can move in 4 directions and to do so you'll have to use your devices.\nFor instance, to move to the right, it's super easy : You put your second device on the right of the first one\nand you just pinch ! The second device become the new spot where you and your friend are (as seen on\nthe mini map in game) and you keep on going until you find the exit ! (before you run out of power and die a horrible death of course ^^)\n\n## Dev process\n\nFor this LD, the theme being running out of power, we thought about an \"escape before\nit's too late\" kind of game but with a interesting twist in the gameplay.\nIn this game, to move from one room to another you use 2 real life devices\nto build your path !\nWe used a library called [Swip JS](https://github.com/paulsonnentag/swip) that let you connect several devices (smartphones, iphones, ipads,\nor even a laptop with touch screen) with only one move, a pinch on the screens.\n\nSince we had to go on the LD39 journey with a super small team, we decided to keep\nall the other fancy elements, like graphics or music, super low key with room for future\nimprovements.\n\nAll assets have been made during the event.\n\n## Screenshots\n![begin.gif](///raw/88f/2/z/6c3a.gif)\n\n![ezgif.com-optimize.gif](///raw/88f/2/z/6ca5.gif)\n\n![first-screen.png](///raw/88f/2/z/6c97.png)\n\n![second-screen.png](///raw/88f/2/z/6c9a.png)\n\n![finish-screen.png](///raw/88f/2/z/6c9c.png)\n\n### Controls\n- Move : Your fingers\n\n\n## Set up Project\n\n### Install dependency\nThe project has one dependency : NodeJs.\n\nSo first let's install it :\n\n#### Windows and MacOs\nYou can download installer on the [NodeJs website](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n\n#### Linux\nOpen a terminal\n```\n    sudo apt-get update\n    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -\n    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n ```\n\n### Compile and start the game\n\nYou have to get the sources.\nTo do it, you need to download the ZIP folder of the game on [Github](https://github.com/guillaume-gomez/LD39) (like in the picture below).\n\n![github-download.png](///raw/88f/2/z/8379.png)\n\nFor the next steps, let's consider that you **have extracted the ZIP** directly in the Downloads folder (you can extract it whatever you want but you will need to adapt the path in the command lines in the next part of the guide).\n\n## Build from sources\n\n#### Windows, Linux and Mac\nOpen a terminal, and type the following\n```\ncd Downloads/LD39-master\nnpm install\nnpm run build\ncd client\nnpm install\nnpm run build\ncd ..\nnpm start\n```\n_The last command launch the server_.\n\nOk, so your serveur is started (Do not kill the terminal until you stop playing the game).\nNow you can see the result on your computer, to visualize go to `localhost:3000` on your favorite browser.\n\nThere is one last step to connect your portable devices (Smartphone, Iphone, Ipads, Kindle, etc).\n\nYou will need your network local address by typing in **another** terminal (your devices need to be connected on the same network as your pc by simply connecting your device on WIFI).\n\nSo on linux, and mac, open a terminal and enter\n```\n  ifconfig\n```\n\n![ipv4-mac.png](///raw/88f/2/z/837b.png)\n\nFor instance my local address is `192.168.1.125`\n\nOn Windows, on a terminal too, and enter\n```\n  ipconfig\n```\n\n![ipv4-windows.png](///raw/88f/2/z/837a.png)\n\n\nFor instance my local address is `192.168.1.125`\n\n**The local adress can change, so don't hesitate to check this address.

The twist is that you can choose to lose any of these powers at any moment in the game by removing parts of your clothing. By doing this you lose a power but this action may help you overcome some obstacles that would be impossible to overcome without losing that power. For example: you start the game with sunglasses that allow you to stay on bright areas indefinitely. But there are some really dark areas that you cannot traverse if you are using those glasses so you can choose to remove them in order to overcome the darkness.

New game designs, new algorithms, new technology. In this time I had an opportunity to work with HTC Vive hardware. So I decided to make my first VR game. I have no wish to compete with other participants. My plan is to use LD as a motivation kick.\n\nIn the result, I'm happy. I made VR game that I have fun to play. It's quite challenging even for me, but after 3 days of playtesting I can guarantee that game can be beaten.\n\nAlmost all 3D models and textures I get from Unity Asset Store (some of them free, some of them paid). Most of the sounds from FreeSound.org. But the whole level was assembled by me from scratch and there a lot of places to walk (without gameplay rewards, unfortunately). For the VR locomotion I used scripts from Asset Store. After playing different games I came to a conclusion that arm swinging is the best solution to locomotion after teleporting. But teleporting ruins immersion, what is the main feature of VR technology.\n\nI recommend you to launch the game on Ultra setting. There no heavy effects and game are pretty optimized. I have no issues with fps on GTX 1060 and i5-7600K. And I can't guarantee that everything will look good on lower settings.\n\nWalkthrough video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NiIZMBqqSg\n\np.s.

As a result, the sliders can sometimes combine to be more than 100% of the maximum power. The enemy damage and spawn curves were left somewhat unpolished and on the easy side.

I used Unity 2017 as an engine and Paint.net for art.\n\n## ​Goal\n\n​The goal with the game is to kill as many monsters as you can and at the same prevent your batteries to run dry. When you kill a monster they drop energy essence. Just by walking close to the essence your battery automatically ​attracts and collects it. This will add charge to your battery that will help you to stay alive. If your charge reaches zero you're out.\n\n## Controls\n#### Keyboard:\n​Left Arrow + Right Arrow = Move\nZ = Jump   X = Shoot   Space = Start\n\n#### Controller: (Only windows)\nLeft joystick = Move\nX/A = Jump   Square/X = Shoot   Start = Start\nCircle/B = Alt Jump   Triangle/Y = Alt Shoot\n\n## Weapons\n#### Pistol\nThe pistol is the weakest weapon in the game. You are required to hit a monster twice to kill it with this weapon. however it has a high fire rate and a large ammo clip to compensate for this.\n\n#### Revolver\nThe revolver is twice as powerful as the pistol. It has a lower fire rate and not as much ammo but is generally easier to control since you only require 1 hit to kill a monster.\n\n#### Rifle\nThe rife is a bit different from the other weapons. Instead of using normal bullet it's using high velocity bullets to penetrate a whole line of enemies. This result in a deadly weapon that is useful to clear lines of enemies with only 1 bullet. The cost of this is the low ammo clip size which makes you think twice before you firing a round.\n\n#### Rocket Launcher\nThe rocket launcher uses high explosive rounds that do damage in an area on impact. This weapon has a mediocre fire rate and ammo clip size but is useful for when enemies have stacked up and are close together.\n\n#### Shotgun\nThe shotgun is the only weapon in the game that shoots multiple bullets at once. This weapon has, just like the rocket launcher, a mediocre fire rate and ammo clip size which makes it good to use in almost every situation.\n\n![Splash.png](///raw/298/8/z/72d9.png)\n\n## Download\nYou can either download the game directly from github bellow or from the games Itch.io page: https://neathan.itch.io/power-surge\n\n#### Web:\nFollow one of the following links to access the web version: https://neathan.github.io/Running-out-of-Power/ https://neathan.itch.io/power-surge (Doesn't work with Safari.

One thing to note is that the executable (.exe) has to be in the same directory as the PowerSurge_Data folder. (Windows defender might warn you that the program is from an unknown source, just press show more and run anyway to start the game)​\n\n#### Mac:\nJust extract the rar or zip file and you have your app. (You might have to right click on the app and the select open to be able to start the game)​\n\n## Change log\n* Disabled rifles debug ammo.\n* Fixed bullet collision problem.\n\n## To note\nOne thing to note is that the game was originally only made for 16:9 resolutions but since many mac computers use 16:10 i implemented a work around for that. But as a result of this the level itself will not look as good as it would in a 16:9 resolution. Even though it's a minor design flaw I would still recommend that you play the game in 16:9 if you have the option.\n\n## Source\nThe source is available at: https://github.com/Neathan/Running-out-of-Power\n\n## Itch.io\nThe game is also published on itch.io.

You get negative points at the end for wasted tiles that don't connect to anything, but sometimes you just have to get rid of tiles if you get 3 bad ones.\n- Per usual the real pro strategy is just to go into the config file in the assets folder and make up your own values for everything.\n\n![Screenshot2.PNG](///raw/17b/1/z/6787.png)\n\n## Dev notes and takeaways:\n- The usual lesson of being an adult sucks when it comes to having time for Game Jams, Only got about 2 half days to do something. I guess it's \"done enough\" to submit, and I wanted to check out the new LD site, just wish it were I theme I was more inspired by.\n- My main reason for doing gamejams is to try to learn new tools I don't use in my day job. So I got in a time machine and went back 10 years and decided to use SDL alone for this project ( hence no sounds and bitmap font.) Didn't have time to change the font so that's just a direct rip from lazyfoo's SDL setup tutorials. It was pretty interesting going back to basics and having to think about every little detail. Ah... Manually making spritesheets, setting up my own pathfinding, texture management being the first thing you have to do before even prototyping, giant message polling to parse out events, nothing like a trip through the good old days to make you appreciate what you have.  Except I still spent like 2 hours trying to get xcode to build/link properly some things are eternal.\n- I'm done designing puzzle games where you can't display the score as the game is in progress. It's too confusing. Score here is derived by the total pieces used in the SHORTEST paths to each house, with a different cost for each node ( 1 for green squares, 5 for normal, 30 for red ) and a penalty x3 times the number of pieces wasted. Since we can't know what's wasted until the entire grid is complete it's hard to explain. Also since the levels are random ( if I had more time I probably would have just picked some rand seeds I liked ) it's hard to tell people what a \"good\" score is, probably at < 150 or so on most levels I saw.\n- Another thing I had to cut was originally green squares were worth negative points. Meaning you could actually end up with a better than 0 costs, as if someone had paid you to lay out the tiles. It didn't really work with the fiction so it confused 100% of playtesters ( all one of them and I kind of agreed. ) Disappointing because one of the cool things about video game A* is that nodes can have negative costs, which isn't allowed in the real world.\n- Speaking of A* shortest paths, I didn't think of this until I was done but it's really confusing when all path's don't highlight and only the shorest ones do. I find I'm often confused that the long paths don't work if there was a shortcut already found. I should have just followed all tiles and not done real pathfinding.\n\nTools:\n- SDL\n- MSPaint ( RIP )\n"},{"id":35143,"event":"jam","name":"System.reLight","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/system-relight","authors":["Reggnos"],"body":"![power_out_main_menu.png](///raw/6b7/8/z/8267.png)\n\nGreetings insert Robot name here, your new AI is up and running, just in time too.

There was going to be more characters to choose from in the action story other than the knight, and more types of stories like an exploration one. There is supposed to be a story going on behind the stories being told, but I decided to cut them short since I figured it was better to finish developing the game play to develop a full enough experience for what it is. So if the beginning of the game is a little out of place, I just kept it there to show there was supposed to be more.

If they're all empty at the end of a turn you'll lose.\n\nYour powers will spend different amounts of energy, the circled number in the upper right corner.\n\nThe damage a power deals is displayed in the lower left corner.\n\nIf you ever start a turn without being able to use any of your powers you lose.\n\nEach point of enemy damage will drain energy from a pool at random.\n\nThere are three types of powers:\nAttack powers deal damage, they're represented by a sword in the upper left corner.\n\nDefence powers reduce damage taken, they're represented by a shield in the upper left corner.\n\nSupport powers regenerate energy, they're represented by a circled plus in the upper left corner.\n\nThe enemy will give you a generic tell. It's an indication of what it might do.\n\nYou pick an power to use against it.\n\nFire counters Water.\nWater counters Fire.\nAir counters Air.\nEarth counters Earth.\n\nFire is resitant to Fire.\nWater is resistant to Water.\nAir is resistant to Earth.\nEarth is resistant to Air.\n\nDefence counters Attack, it will half the damage taken and cancel any extra ability the Attack power might provide. If it belongs to the counter element it will nullify the damage completely. If a Defence power doesn't face an Attack any special abilities it might provide do not trigger.\n\nResistance halves damage as well(e.g.: Using a Fire Attack on a Fire elemental will cause it to only take half damage). If it also happened to defend it will nullify the entire damage.\n\nHalved values are rounded up.\n\nAttack counters Support if it is of the counter element(e.g. a Water Attack will prevent a Fire Support from doing anything, an Air Attack will prevent an Air Support from doing anything).\n\nAfter you defeat an enemy you will receive energy depending on its level.\n\nYou also get your choice of one of three powers. The powers are tied to the element of the defeated enemy(e.g.: A Fire enemy will most likely offer Fire powers and energy, it might offer some Earth and/or Air powers and energy, but it will never generate any Water powers or energy).\n\nYou can choose to skip any of three powers and get more energy.\n\nThere are four waves of lesser elementals followed by four waves of greater elementals. If you defeat all eight you win the game.\nIf you ever run out of energy or start a turn without any usable powers you lose."},{"id":36627,"event":"jam","name":"Energy Scraps","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/energy-scraps","authors":["Royoyo","Sergius","Wijes"],"body":"!!!Press TAB to lock/unlock mouse cursor\n________________________________________\n\nCreated for the 39th Ludum Dare Game Jam.\n\nYou had emergency landing and you're almost out of energy to support yourself.

In the game player has multiple generators\nthat they can power on and off at will, and they provide power. While powered generators are getting damaged, and if they are destroyed, player can't use them until they are fully repaired.\n\nBuildings generate tasks that need to be done. Tasks require power to be executed, some will lose the progress, if they lose power access. In order for building to perform tasks player needs to click on them, to power them. While they are powered they will consume power to progress the task. Task progression is scaled by the efficiency (amount of power you are producing/ amount of power required) so if your efficiency is low, tasks will progress slower, and also the generators will struggle and get damaged even more. So try to keep the efficiency high.\n\nIf you fail 3 tasks, the game ends and you are presented with the score you achieved.\n\nThe game has 3 level types that are randomly generated with predefined power generators (each level type uses different generators).

Nothing is real, everything is merely a projection of your mind. But it doesn’t feel like something made up. Guilt is taking over you, bringing hallucinations. Will they be too real to bear?\n\n Your sanity is what keeps you alive. If you experience too many disturbing things – you die. \nYou lose your sanity constantly, more if your torch light is dim. Every weird sound, every haunt that touches you, or personification of your guilt may lower your sanity. And the less sanity, the more strange things happen… Restore your sanity by standing next to candles. You need it.\n\nBe on the lookout of chests.

This is a physical card game!\n\n## Story\n\nYou find yourself stranded on the fabled island of Atlantis. Once a spectacular nation, now it lies in shambles due to a plague. You have a battery powered HEV suit for protection, but the battery power is running out. Play this exciting card game and see who can last the longest!\n\n## Requirements\n\n* A set of Save Atlantis cards. (A standard 52 card deck can be substituted for this)\n* A power die, perhaps a six sided die, for each player.\n* A token for each player. (a miniature figurine or a beer bottle cap)\n* 2 to 4 players.\n\n## Game Setup\n\n1. Shuffle the deck.\n2. Each player draws five cards.\n3. Place a single card face down on the table.\n4. Each player chooses and places a token on top of the face down card.\n5. Each player takes a power die and places it's highest value upwards.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe goal of the game is to be the last one in the game.\n\nIf your power die reaches zero (e.g. you have one power, and must reduce it) you are removed from the game.\n\n### Start of Turn\n\nEach player takes turns, starting with the cutest. (You may fight amongst yourselves over this qualifier)\n\n#### At the start of your turn:\n\n1. Reduce your power die by one.\n2. Draw a card into your hand.\n3. Draw a second card without looking at it, and place it adjacent to any card on the table.\n\n_Note: Your card must be able to fit on the table. If you only have room for one card, consider finding a larger table, you nut._\n\n#### Phase 2 - During your turn you may:\n\n1. Move to an adjacent card that is face down. \n\n* For every move you make, reduce your power die by 1. (You must have 2 or more power to move or you will die)\n* Flip that card right-side up and activate it. Follow the instructions on the card.\n2. Play any card from your hand.\n\n* Any card played may be countered (or nullified) by anyone who plays a card with a value higher than the card you are playing.\n* Face cards cannot be countered\n\nYou may choose to do (1) and (2) as much as you are able to. Your turn ends when you have exhausted your ability do either 1 or 2 or you declare your turn over. \n\n## Game play without Save Atlantis cards\n\n__These instructions are if you only have a standard 52 card deck__\n\nIf you activate a:\n\n* diamond (a recharge card), recharge your power die up to two.\n* spade (a bomb card), you may destroy any card on the table that does not have a player on it.\n* heart (a build card), you must draw a card, and place it face down somewhere on the table adjacent to another card.\n* club (a vision card), you may personally reveal a face down card to yourself. You can choose to flip that card face up. If you do, it does not activate.\n\nAces are low.\n\nIf you land on a face card, you must discard a card. If that card is a face card, you draw two cards and activate the face card's suit twice.\n\n## Build\n\n1. Run love (0.10.2) against the src folder, which builds the cards in your save directory.\n2. Move the cards to build/cards/\n3. run build/montage.sh from the build folder\n4. output-*.png is what you're looking for\n\n## Credits\n\n* Creative Direction, Game Mechanics and Programming: [@josefnpat](http://twitter.com/josefnpat)\n* Art and Playtesting: [@bytedesigning](http://twitter.com/bytedesigning)\n* Graphic Design, Playtesting and Asshatery: [@artschu](http://twitter.com/artschu)\n* Playtesting and Assistant Nacho Manager: [@chrisronin](http://twitter.com/chrisronin)\n* Playtesting and Music: [@eternalnightpro](http://twitter.com/eternalnightpro)"},{"id":45165,"event":"jam","name":"All of Me","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/all-of-me","authors":["Linheha","Lucien Catonnet"],"body":"### Description\nSimple scene with a few interactions (there are things to do).

Even if you leave only negative feedback. Thank you for taking the time.\n\n---\n\nQuick info related to this project:\n- The game was created only by myself. My name's Bastian aka Anudin. Hi :)\n- I do next to no game dev besides these jams. Therefore I consider myself a beginner even though this is my third entry.\n- This was my first experience ever with audio.\n- Created with: Godot engine, Aseprite, GIMP and Audacity.\n\n---\n\n![cover.png](///raw/394/3/z/6d8a.png)\n\n[WARNING: This game relies on positional audio but most people should be fine with their audio systems.]\n\n**Blind are the ones' afraid to see. So do you dare to stare into the abyss?**\n\n**How to play (there is also an in development ingame tutorial)**\n\nYou're hunted. In order to escape you must find the safe way - and you only hear your enemy. \n\nAt the start of each round the level will be illuminated for a very short time. Memorize the locations of the doors, then click on a door which you think is safe.  If your decision was correct you will find yourself in the next room otherwise it's back to the start of the level.\n\nIf you forget where the door is click to activate your flashlight. But be careful: the flashlights batteries are only refilled every level!\n\n[Luvius - Itch.io](https://anudin.itch.io/luvius)"},{"id":34583,"event":"compo","name":"Runaway Convoy","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/runaway-convoy","authors":["Hilvon"],"body":"Take command of a small convoy fleeing warzone.

Although it is still incomplete, we're very proud of what we've accomplished and hope that you enjoy roaming our small, buggy and randomly generated levels.\nNovember Hail is a game about a guy who helps restore a town's energy by killing scary, robot crabs. You can sell the scraps of these crabs for more energy. This can be put to waste by killing more crabs with your energy consuming laser gun. If you ever happen to fully run out of energy, you can borrow a loan from the banker, but you will need to pay it back or you'll be sitting around for a very, VERY long time.\nAnyway, we hope you enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed making it.

The question remains, though, if the CCR and Cryogenic Operating System (CryOS) want the colonists to be revived...\n\n### Builds\n\nSee below for links to the builds.\n\nAdvanced warning that the Linux build has not been tested. The Mac one may require you to change some security settings on your Mac. Also, please note that the WebGL version differs slightly as you cannot multi-thread in WebGL, so the game may lag slightly when pathfinding.\n\n### Tips\n\nRead the messages provided by the game. First, build solar panels to slow down the loss of power. The first mine to be built should be a silicon mine. Stabilize first, then start to grow. Remember, mines MUST be powered to work.\n\n### Goal\n\nYou must build certain items to complete the game. These can be checked by clicking the Check Colony button on the screen. Also, the ship's battery can not be losing power.\n\n### Tools Used\n\n- Unity 5.6.0f3\n- Bfxr for creating sound effects\n- GIMP 2 for image editing\n- Bosca Ceoil\n\n\n### Contributors\n\nFor posterity sake, this game was developed completely in 72 hours by myself and my two sons. We each contributed the following items:\n\n- James: Most coding, some UI development\n- Anthony: Coding, most UI development\n- Cameron: Art, music, and sound effects\n\nWe hope you enjoy our second entry into the Ludum Dare game jam as much as we enjoyed making it."},{"id":36490,"event":"compo","name":"Energy Collector","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/energy-collector","authors":["peremily"],"body":"## Objective\nIn this game the main objective is to run an energy business, you have to set up the solar panels, charging stations and the portal for the customers to come through\n\n# WARNING\nunfortunately the timer seems to not work in the WebGL version, I didn't think to test it.

Charging stations take energy from the main grid, but they can be placed anywhere. Ships come through the portals and have a chance that they'll need fuel, so they'll find the nearest charging station to go to that is available, once it has found one that charging station is in use so no other ship can go to it until the ship has charged.

The countryside has experienced a major power outage, and it’s up to you to re-wire the grid and restore power.\n\nThe game is essentially a basic math puzzle combined with a “pipes” style grid. You install and remove power lines and resistor towers to make sure the houses get the correct amount of power.\n\n## Controls\n\nMouse only. Select a tool using the bar at the bottom of the screen, click on the grid to place it. Click on an existing piece of hardware to remove it.\n\n## Goals\n\nI wanted to make something simple and polished, or, as polished as a Comp entry can be. During my last LudumDare, I overshot and ended up producing little more than a tech demo with some minor humor. This time around I wanted to make sure I actually built something I could call a “game”.\n\nIt may not be the most imaginative or complex thing in the world, but it feels significantly more refined than my last entry.\n\n## Issues\n\nUntested in Firefox, please use a WebKit or Blink based browser for now. Chrome recommended.\n\nIn some cases a power line can be placed in a three-way connection with two generators and a resistor. This often makes it look like the lines are leading to the resistor, but are actually ignoring it.\n\nLinking a resistor in a loop to another resistor causes a power drain and drops them both to 0.\n\n## Tools\n\nGame written entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. \nGraphic work was done in Photoshop and processed through CodeKit 3.\nMusic was generated with WolframTones. \nSound effects generated with Bfxr.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![screen_1.png](///raw/f99/2/z/6176.png)\n"},{"id":34862,"event":"jam","name":"ZombieZurvivor","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/zombiezurvivor","authors":["Mads"],"body":"![Front.png](///raw/a28/8/z/56aa.png)\n\n*Power is valueable, don not run out...*\n\nZombieZurvivor is close to a classic shoot and survive but with a twist.

You play as a Wisp, an ancient creature made entirely out of light. Your objective is simple ... stay alive as long as you can until your power runs out. Try it out and see how long will your light last!\n\n## Basic Rules:\n\nUse W A S D keys to move around.\n\nYour life bar is the light around you. When you move, shoot (left mouse button), swing(right mouse button), or use an item ( keys #1 and #2) you lose your light(life). You can hold the right mouse button to keep swinging.\n\nYour main source of power is harvested through glowing rocks scattered around the map. To harvest their energy simply get close to them. If you do not consume the full energy from a glowing rock , they will regenerate and go back to normal. It is also important to note that glowing rocks when fully charged can sometimes spread to other rocks around them.\n\nAnother good source of energy is the ones gathered from light particles. Light Particles are droped by every enemy when when they are killed. Those light particles can be harvested by the player if he comes near them but they also dissipate over time so be quick!\n\nThere are 2 craftable items: \n\n-> **Beacon** : Atracts shadows / enemies\n\n-> **Barrier**: They are obstacles that prevent enemies from atacking the player by blocking their path (ranged enemies cant shoot through barriers. Even though barriers prevent enemies from atacking ... they allow the player to shoot through.\n\nBoth items have a time limit and are upgradable. You gain XP (experience points) when you kill shadows and once you reach a certain ammount of XP you gain a new level and the item's button will change to green. At that time you have to chose what item you want to upgrade (both are upgradable 3 times).\n\n**Upgrades:**\n\n->Beacon Level 1 -> Duration == **5 Seconds**\n\n->Beacon Level 2 -> Duration == **7 Seconds**\n\n->Beacon Level 3 -> Duration == **10 Seconds**\n\n\n->Barrier Level 1 -> Duration == **5 Seconds**\n\n->Barrier Level 2 -> Duration == **7 Seconds**\n\n->Barrier Level 3 -> Duration == **10 Seconds**\n \n\n## Tools:\n\n->> Unity,\n\n->> Audacity,\n\n->> Blender,\n\n->> paint.NET\n\n->> Inkscape\n\n## Screenshoots:\n\n![mainMenu.png](///raw/da3/z/81d4.png)\n\n![Screenshoot1.png](///raw/da3/z/81d5.png)\n\n![screenshoot3.png](///raw/da3/z/7e5e.png)\n\n![screenshoot4.png](///raw/da3/z/7e5f.png)\n"},{"id":35068,"event":"jam","name":"Video Child","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/video-child","authors":["BobFish"],"body":"Its 1989.

These fields show your current stats.\n\n### Tip:\n\nIn the Roman republic, you could only be consul ones and only for 2 (/4) years. To stay in power longer there had to be some type of war going on. So if you want to stay in power longer than the regular 24 month you have to have the War-law activated.\n\n## Finishing\n\nI had much fun creating this game and I hope you have at least some while playing.

Three different difficulties to choose from, so feel free to play at whatever skill level you're comfortable with! \n\nA short 8 level game about trying to escape form a shadow world. Each of the non-boss levels has a different objective, and there are 3 enemy types, 3 bosses, and 3 environments. \n\n**Some Clarification for those coming in to play it**\n\nYou should try to stay in the light, but don't over-use your batteries as you may need them when you least expect it.\n\nYellow dots are batteries, and blue dots are ammo.\n\nYou lose sanity by spending time in the light of a Snake statue or standing in the dark. You gain sanity by spending time in the light, though extremely slowly. Sanity causes enemies to spawn faster and move faster.\n\nYou light lampposts and other objects by pressing E. This consumes a battery. The first world has Lamp Posts, the second world has Candles, and the third world has these weird spherical alien things.\n\nTop left shows your battery count, you can only hold 5 at a time.\n\nTop right shows your ammo count.\n\nBottom left shows your health.\n\nBottom right shows your sanity.\n\nIn the third level, those weird grayish things are the generators you need to light. The amount that are remaining is shown at the bottom.\n\nAfter the second boss, you need to seek out green egg piles and shoot them. The amount remaining is shown at the bottom of the screen.\n\nCrow-like enemies grow in size, speed, and health after colliding with another crow. Try to prevent them from becoming unmanageable!\n\n**About this Project***\n\nI made this myself from scratch, using a few public domain resources here and there. This is my first game jam ever!

You had finite bullets and shooting would reduce your damage output each time. If you wasted them on trash mobs, the boss would be (nearly) impossible. After we added some graphical effects, shooting became way too fun so we scrapped the original idea and tried a few other things. We ultimately decided to shy away from the theme in favour of making the game as fun as possible.\n\nAs is tradition, we went into Ludum Dare with a lot of ambition and ended up having to cut a lot of content. We originally had four stages planned but due to time restraints we cut it down to a single stage that has a mini boss, instead of full stages with full bosses.\n\nAll-in-all, we're fairly proud of this game despite the severe lack of polish and plan to clean up the code, polish the engine, and try to make a more full game.

That may not have been the best idea as I was making level content for it right up until an hour before I submitted it, and that last hour was taken up by making the intro music.\n\nI usually spend the last half a day making music for LD games, so this was a fumble on my part.\n\nAs such I recommend you listen to your own music while playing. I recommend anything by AC/DC, any power-metal, RCHP's 'Zephyr Song', Rocketman, Let's Go fly a kite... \n\nThere does appear to be a bug on the WebGL version where the jetpack exhaust doesn't stop when you enter a 2-tile high corridor. The ability itself stops (so you're not wasting any fuel) but the graphic doesn't. This only happens on the WebGL version and I only noticed it after publishing and didn't have time to fix it. it doesn't appear to happen on the Windows version, so if it gets annoying try the download link.\n\n## Development Videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX82jPFES0c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBDZL0RsR4g\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP0XdVkCzW4\n"},{"id":33590,"event":"compo","name":"AA City","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/aa-city","authors":["Raogs"],"body":"### Description\nIn AA City you have to charge the Batteries so the City has electricity.

The substation lowers the voltage to residential values.\n- Connect the substation to the residential areas using low voltage lines, people don't mind these near their houses.\n- The city will grow into new blocks and upgrade existing ones much faster into well powered and valued areas.\n- The city won't tolerate three power outages in a single month.\n- Don't grow your grid too fast at the start of the game, or else the city power demand will get unmanageable quickly.\n- If you pollute too much, the city will start imposing penalties by taxing your income.\n- Base price per kWh varies each month, by external factors you cannot control.\n- You can see the currently powered zones by using the \"POWER\" button on the left.\n\n**​Missing features (maybe I'll implement them post-jam):**\n- More important than anything else: **Balance**.

It's always gratifying to finish a game, even if it's a piece of shit. In this case, lets face it, a HUMONGOUS piece of crap. I was definitely rusty both on unity and c# for this challenge. It took me a long time to get comfortable with the whole thing. After the first 6h it was clear to me that the game ideas was not good, and I was having to much trouble executing it. In summary, you are watching the remains of the battlefield between me and Unity's UI system...and I was massacred. I did learn a bunch so I won't hide in the basement to cry ;)\nPS: The € thing instead of $ is intended.\n\n__Some Notes for the future:__\n- I spent a lot of time reading the Unity Scripting API, UnityAnswers forum and StackOverflow to refresh a lot of things I already know. Next time do a 1 day intensive warm-up the week before or less intense during the whole week. \n\n## Tools\n- Unity 5.6\n- Audacity (for Sound)\n- Lunapic (for Graphics)\n- Bosca Ceoil (For the music)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Source Code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t419vnv3ev4sdgh/EnergyTycoonSource.zip?dl=0)\n- [Win32](https://www.dropbox.com/s/medqephbxwi1we4/CoalGameWin.zip?dl=0)\n- [MacOS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/beueb2me9tbpc2u/CoalGameMac.app.zip?dl=0)\n- [Web](https://gris.itch.io/Coal-Game)\n\n## 48hours + Noob = Bugs\n\nI probably won't fix anything since I didn't like the idea or execution. This is just an acknowledgement of bugs and things lacking.\n\n- No timer to know how long you last. \n- No main menu.\n- No pause button.\n- Better screen adjustment to resize stuff according with screen.\n- Maybe keep a record of highscores?\n- Total lack of animations(It's horrible in general but it could've used some anyway)"},{"id":37028,"event":"compo","name":"Ludum Dare 39 - Battery Man","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/ludum-dare-39-battery-man","authors":["TedKerr"],"body":"CONTROLS: arrow keys to move, x to jump.

You are the only survivor, but your weapons systems are down and your fuel tanks are running low.\n\nThere might be just enough energy crystals floating in the debris to get you home, but can you break through the enemy's lines?\n\nGood luck, soldier. We're counting on you!\n\n### The Tools\n* **Game engine**: [Unity 2d](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-creation)\n* **Graphics**: [Pyxel Edit](http://pyxeledit.com/) and [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/)\n* **Sound**: [Chiptone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/)\n\n[![Cover Image](///content/65a/1/z/6c3e.png)](https://ninjascribble.github.io/LudumDare39/)\n\n### Tips\n* Tap the Left and Right arrow keys to move around.\n* Use the Up arrow key to deploy energy reserves. You only have three, so use them wisely!\n* The hit boxes are small enought that you can _just_ sneak through enemies in formation.\n\n### The Process\nHonestly, we went into this Ludum Dare with an idea of what _kind_ of game we wanted to build before\nthe themes were even announced. The classic top-down shmup has always been one of my favorite genres\n-- the sense of speed and the immediacy of each movement you make combine to put me into a relaxed\nlittle zen-like state where I can lose hours at a time.\n\nOf course with only a weekend to build something from scratch, there weren't hours to lose! Graphics\ncame first on Friday night, and we were done with the basic gameplay by the end of the first day.\nDay two saw the addition of enemies, some tweaks to the game speed, and all of the non-gameplay scenes.\n\nYes, you _can_ win. I've done it exactly once, and it's damn hard to make it happen. If you do manage\nto win, you'll be rewarded with a short story screen and the chance to play again, although... the\ngameplay might be broken as of the current build so it's best just to reload your browser instead. Heh...\n\nThis was the first entry we've made using Unity 2D. I've been avoiding it because stepping out of code\nand relying on the IDE tends to make me nervous. And yeah, we did have some trouble using the collaboration\ntools (lost work at the end of day 1, no fun), but in the end it did speed up development and make a\nfew things (like supporting fullscreen) a lot easier.\n\nThis was also the first time I've had the chance to use [Chiptone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/),\nwhich makes building game sounds a breeze.

You must figure out how to start a mining operation to extract this gold in the most efficient and compact manner possible. But beware, it takes power to export this gold to the rest of the world, and so you must be careful to keep your power from *running out*. In the beginning, you will only have solar panels, but as you progress, you will gain access to steam engines, and will eventually be forced to set up the infrastructure needed for them. Filling the world with solar panels just won't cut it once you have too many mines for them to keep up with.\n\n*A Decent Mining Operation:*\n![A decent mining operation](///raw/9d1/7/z/6c37.png)\n\n\n## Controls\nLeft Click - Place whatever you have selected\n\nRight Click - Destroy what your mouse is over (Gives you half your money back.)\n\n(Pretty simple, right?)\n\n## Basic Tutorial\nFirst, place four solar panels in a line near a patch of gold and run power lines so that each solar panel is adjacent to a power line. (Most everything can interact with a power line on the 8 tiles surrounding it.) Power lines only connect to each other in the 4 cardinal directions. Place a mine on a gold tile, and connect it to your power network. The \"!\" should disappear when the mine gets power. If you hover over it, you can see the mine's progress and power consumption. Other machines will behave in a similar way. You should start seeing gold be added to your inventory while the solar panels are generating power. Solar panels are useless at night. Placing a gold seller beside a power line will start to sell gold from your inventory for $10 a piece. 1 of these can keep up with two mines. Be careful, to sell gold you need power, so if you *run out of power*, you won't be able to sell gold. You now have a basic mining operation that will mine and sell gold during the day. Now the rest is up to you. I suggest adding another mine. You may need more solar panels to power it. Good luck.\n\n\n[**Click here to play**](http://gre.cobaltrisen.com)\n\n## How to use the steam engines\nAs almost every single comment so far has mentioned that the steam engines are confusing, I may as well talk about how they work. Pipes are used to transfer fluids and behave similarly to power lines. Boilers take coal from your inventory, and when fueled will heat your pipe network by 20 degrees each. They don't connect to pipes on their bottom face. Steam engines are what make power, and require 100 degrees of temperature and 10KL of water each. Water's standard temperature is 20 degrees with no boilers, therefore you need 1 pump and four fueled boilers for the first steam engine, and 1 pump + \nfive boilers for each additional one. If there isn't enough power or fluid available, a machine simply won't run.\n\n## Tools/Languages Used:\n- Code: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n- SFX: [Chiptone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/), [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org)\n- Icons: Photoshop CC\n\nI plan to continue developing GRE, so if you have any suggestions, let me know!\n\n## Updates\n- Fixed boiler price mismatch (Thanks @brazmogu)\n- Made Power and Fluids easier to read from pipes and lines."},{"id":39310,"event":"jam","name":"HOME IS DEAD","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/home-is-dead","authors":["ahintoflime"],"body":"![homeisdead.png](///raw/989/9/z/7aae.png)\n\nPresenting \"HOME IS DEAD\"\n\n\nHome is dead.

Releasing near a spawner will order your sells to try and capture it. To complete a level, you must control all spawners. The camera can be moved using middle mouse button and to cancel the currently selected group of cells from being moved, you can pres right mouse button. Escape can be used to pause the game.\n\nSometimes cells will merge with each other, these makes a bigger more powerful cell which has more health and does more damage against other cells.\n\nThank you for playing, I will try to play and rate anyone who comments on my game.\n\nLinux build works but might have a lower frame rate than it should, now with added 64 bit support (I think).

If not, please give us feedback about WebGL version.\n\nHigh scores are saved when you win the game (that means if you don't blow up), although only from executable versions.

Thank you for entering.\n\n## Game Description\n\n**Power** is and always has been in fragile balance. Human nature makes us ambitious and greedy. Dive into a high-seas adventure as a ship’s captain that must solve the problem of an imminent mutiny. Discover the secrets your sailors keep, and attain all the information needed to uncover the mutineer.\n\nWith **Rats will kiss the gunner's daughter** we’ve wanted to take on the challenge of generating a game with content created in a simple and functional way. Firstly, we turned the theme around, taking “*you are running out of power*” to mean the social kind of power, and not the mechanical or physical interpretation of the phrase that the mind first goes to. Also we’ve created a game environment that puts a lot of focus on human behaviour.\n\nWe hope you fully enjoy the experience and above all, that you make the mutineer kiss the gunner's daughter!\n\n## Game Instructions\n\nClick teh skull to open the daily note and the parchment to see the instructions and your crew.\n\nThis game lasts 5 days. On the 6th day you will have to execute the **mutineer**. Every day you will ask each sailor on your ship a different question.\n\nYou’ll have three options:\n\n*Blue button*: Ask peacefully.\n\n*Red button*: Use violence to get the information. This action will cost you a coin (to hire a bully).\n\n*Yellow button*: Bribe the sailor to get the information. This action will cost you a coin.\n\nEach day have two coins to spend. You can't save up coins to use the next day\n\n### IMPORTANT NOTES:\n- We **strongly** advise you to write down the information you acquire. These sailors will say many things and it may be hard to remember all of it.\n\n- Every time you play the game, the sailors will have a different name and appearance (face, head and body). Don't be afraid to give it a second try!\n\n- Extra point question: where is this ship exactly from?\n\n\n### Updates:\n- We have removed the unfinished language option (it was available in the windowed mode because it wasn't set at 16:9). Problem solved.\n\n- The game icon wasn't set correctly. Problem solved.\n\n### [Download game here](https://mrhoduini.itch.io/rats-will-kiss-the-gunners-daughter)\n\n\n![5.png](///raw/0a7/8/z/7cb0.png)\n______________________________________________________\n![3.png](///raw/0a7/8/z/7cba.png)\n______________________________________________________\n![7.png](///raw/0a7/8/z/7cc2.png)\n______________________________________________________\n![8.png](///raw/0a7/8/z/7cc7.png)"},{"id":35005,"event":"compo","name":"Lamplight","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/lamplight","authors":["Wheffle"],"body":"![screen2.png](///raw/91b/3/z/5e95.png)\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/91b/3/z/5ea1.png)\n\n![icon.png](///raw/91b/3/z/80de.png)\n\n### Description\nLamplight is a game about conserving your magical lamp energy while exploring a dark world filled with shadowy monsters. As long as they are in the darkness, they are invisible to you. However, using your lamp's abilities will help to detect them and ultimately destroy them. Be careful, though, if they manage to sneak up on you they will drain your lamp's energy. When it runs out, the game is over.\n\n### Instructions\nLamplight is a turn-based dungeon crawler on a hex grid. The objective is to clear as many rooms as you can before running out of lamp energy (which will happen sooner or later). Monsters are invisible until you use your lamp's abilities on them. Bright light will stun monsters, making them vulnerable. They also leave tracks as they move, allowing you to try to deduce where they are in the darkness. Follow the tutorial in the first room to learn the basics.\n\nThere isn't a ton of content in the game unfortunately, you'll see everything there is to see on a reasonable run. I feel like the concept was communicated quite well and turned out to be decently fun though.\n\n### About\nThis is my second Ludum Dare. Last time I submitted a \"jam\" game. I had plenty of time and managed to finish quite early, so this time I thought I'd go ahead and do \"compo\". It was definitely much more of a struggle, I don't think I had as solid of an idea as I did last time, and shaving that extra day off really does a number psychologically.

You'll not find any help nor tips in game, but this is very simple : your goal is to steal power on the upper-right corner of the level, and to get back to the lower-left corner (where you started) to take it. Each power charge is counted on the bottom, and there is no limit nor win condition. You have to avoid the robot-guards, if they see you they pursue you, and if they catch you, you're dead (surprised?) Click on a floor tile to move, but be careful : the automatic path do not avoid guards…  \n  \nSome useful informations :  \n  \n • guards can't see through concrete walls, but they can see through glass (and bluish grey thin walls *are* made of glass)  \n • guards vision is 6 tiles long  \n • when they stay somewhere, guards can see 360°  \n • while moving, guards have a 120° wide vision, centered on the direction they go  \n • while in alert mode, if they don't see you for 20 seconds, they go back to their nearest patrol point  \n • alert a guard is a good way to extract it from his patrol path ;) (but it will be faster and will activly search you for a while, so act carefuly with that in mind)  \n • each stolen power charge adds 0.1 tile/second to the guards patrol speed (wich is 1 tile/second at start)  \n \n  \n  \n*Edit : There was a bug with the way the guards detects player presence, it's fixed now. To catch it, I had to add a debug mode, wich is showing basic detections points while moving - so, if you want to have a visible clue of the guards's sight, hit F6 ;)  \n(but, please, keep in mind that this \"function\" was not existing in published version, so don't take that in count for judging)*"},{"id":36099,"event":"jam","name":"Hold My Coffee","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/hold-my-coffee","authors":["sunnray"],"body":"Oh, hi.

So balance your resources between building and powering defenses and launching the rocket. More details about the gameplay are available in-game. You'll see it when you play the game(it will take less than 5 min to play through it, so make sure you go give it a shot!), so let's move on to the creation.\n\nWe decided upon this idea after the reveal of the theme. To be honest, we weren't too happy about the theme due to it leaving comparatively little room for deviation and interpretation, but decided to take part anyway. The overall creation process was surprisingly smooth. We ran into very few bugs during the programming, and no hunches or anything in ideation or asset creation. So yay. Wasn't sure if we could do it, but here we are, finished with, like, 7 hours left.\n\n### Setup\n\nEngine: Unity3D\n\nGraphics: Autodesk Maya 2017, Photoshop CC\n\nAudio: Logic Pro X, Yamaha AG03, NI Guitar Rig 5 Pro\n\nI hope you spare some time to rate our game, and look forward to being part of another jam.

I usually go for Compo but I knew 100% life would be a factor so I figure why stress out.  I took my time and a great deal of breaks and you know what, I'm really happy with this entry :)\n\nThis is based a bit on an old Intellivision game called \"Atlantis\", similar to Missile Command.\n\nThe object of the game is to shoot down enemy's that are hurtling toward your city.  Why are they doing this?  They crave your power, or something like that.  You must manage your power usage throughout.  As you fire, power is consumed.  Power is also what protects your city from the invaders so as you use power be careful not to run out.  You can get power packs that randomly spawn from enemies to regain some of your reserves.  If you stop shooting you'll recharge but at a slow rate.  Enemies that make it through the shield will reduce your power and prevent recharging for about 1 seconds (firing your weapons also initiate a 1 second recharge delay).  If you manage to get your power above 100%, you'll start to do more damage with your weapons as well.  But be careful, the more power you have the more enemies will spawn ;)\n\nThe more enemies you kill the more of them will spawn.  At level 4, their speed increases and their hit points as well.  This will happen with each level after and there is no technical level cap, I've managed to get to Level 8.\n\nThere are a great deal of features I wanted to add but ran out of time but like I said, I'm really happy with this one and think I accomplished all of my \"Must Haves\".  \n\nTools:\nUnity/C#\nPaint.Net\nBfxr.exe (sound)\nBosca Ceoil (music)\nWith the exception of that lovely shield, all Art from Kenney.nl.\n\nThere is a WebGL version and it should work fine in this game.  Previously I mistakenly used the right mouse button for input and realized when it was too late that Mac users and Touchpad users were basically left unable to play.  This time around the controls are hopefully much better:\n\nFire Left Cannon:  Control's Fire 1 button, Left Mouse Button, or Keyboard \"A\"\nFire Right Cannon:  Control's Fire 2 button, Right Mouse Button, or Keyboard \"D\"\nDon't like the sound?

Feel free to pause to consult this anytime. :-)\n\n![PauseScreen.png](///raw/285/9/z/861f.png)\n\n\n## DOWNLOAD LINKS:\n\nWebGL (no download required!): https://pixelgamewizard.itch.io/runnerbot\n\nWindows: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbjd0q3u3npcsjb/Runnerbot_v_1_0_Windows.zip?dl=1\n\nMac*: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5m8kjhbigzq4r1/Runnerbot_v_1_0_MacOSX.zip?dl=1 \n\nLinux: https://www.dropbox.com/s/z899kw5r2utqalj/Runnerbot_v_1_0_Linux.zip?dl=1\n\n(* I have very little experience with Mac. Please let me know if this doesn't work.)\n\n\n## FEEDBACK:\n\nThis is my first Ludum Dare (and also the first game I've ever published!)... so I really do appreciate feedback. If you're otherwise having trouble coming up with feedback for me, I'd really like to know:\n\n- How would you suggest I balance difficulty in a game like this? What kind of specific feedback would you ask from playtesters?\n\n- How did you personally find the game difficulty/balance?\n\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES:\n\nAlthough I spent as much time as I could in these 72 hours finding and squashing bugs, I'm sure I missed a few. If you find some, please let me know!\n\n- The procedural generation is somewhat... crude. Although I implemented safeguards to make sure the game is playable, I have seen on **very** rare occasion a complete wall generate from the very top of the screen to bottom, blocking your way. If this happens to you, I'd love to see a screenshot so I can try to debug it.\n\n- No audio.\n\n- The high score only works for your instance of the game. If you close the game, and open it later... It'll reset to the default of 10000.\n\n\n## EXTRA FEATURE:\n\nIf you want to try something different... then turn on \"Constant Running Mode\" by pressing the P key while in-game. In this mode, you cannot stop - if you hit a wall or other obstacle, Runnerbot will simply choose a new direction to go in. If you don't like it, you can turn it off by pressing the P key a second time. :-)\n\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:\n\nTools:\n\n- Unity3D Engine: Game engine.\n\n- Visual Studio Code: Coding! Yay! This works in Linux too!\n\n- GIMP: For making graphics\n\n- Blender: For making models\n\nCommercial-use-friendly fonts from the following links:\n\n- http://www.fontspace.com/cedders/segment7\n\n- http://www.fontspace.com/coding4web-com/digital\n\n- http://www.fontspace.com/lcd-solid/lcd-solid\n\n## CHANGELOG\n\nV.1.0a - Removed some personal meta information from the build settings. Changed a few things around supported resolutions. Also a later edit to this post to clarify the rules a bit more (sleep-deprived me so not-good at write-good).\n\nV.1.0b - Added black quads to the outside of the screen area (full-screen web player apparently ignores the list of supported resolutions, so this was necessary to avoid strange rendering artefacts in full-screen). Updated the pause screen to show the correct textures for \"wall\" and \"conveyor\" tiles."},{"id":38462,"event":"compo","name":"Drought","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/drought","authors":["tacohej"],"body":"The desert can be one unforgiving place.

I didn't have a lot of time so I went with the \"higher level\" functions of HTML5 compared to C++ to save some time and it has the added benefit of being extremely platform independent.

S"],"body":"![7258.gif](///raw/350/5/z/787f.gif)\n\n\n## Overview\nA 1v1 fighting game built around the theme “Running out of power”. Players battle it out as 2 RC Bots, running on unfortunately tiny batteries. To win Botken, you must push your opponent off the edge of the arena and get them plugged. No HP, no timers: Botken is about dominating the arena, managing your power and showing the world what a tin-can can do!\n\n\n![72af.gif](///raw/350/5/z/777f.gif)\n\n\n## How To Play\nThe Bots always move forward automatically, and each has 4 inputs (Player 1 on the left uses WASD, and Player 2 on the right uses the Arrow Keys):\n\n- W / Up - for a High Attack\n- S / Down - for a Low Attack\n- D / Left - for a Dash Attack\n- A / Right - for a Backdash\n\nWatch your opponent and react with the right move to inch them closer to the plug, or go full aggro and smash them into it.\n#### Gameplay Subtleties\n##### Bot Power Knockback\nThe power you have in store determines how far you are going to fly off when hit by an attack. The less power in store, the further the distance you’re knocked back!\nNote that performing attacks costs a bit of energy, but getting hit costs more.\n\nWhen running completely out of energy, the Bot enters recovery mode, regenerating its power over the course of a few seconds. It cannot act while doing so; it is our version of a “Stun”. Pro-tip: Hitting an opponent in recovery mode will stop the recovery at the amount it is at the moment they get hit.\n##### Combo Counter\nThe higher the current combo, the more Power is drained when landing a hit on the opponent.\n\nThe combo counter increases for every hit a player lands without getting hit in return, and drops to 0 whenever the other player starts his own combo streak.\n\nHit fast, hit hard, hit often!\n\n\n\n#### Stable mode: https://hu9o.itch.io/botken\n#### Experimental online mode: http://vps417653.ovh.net:3333/\n"},{"id":42072,"event":"jam","name":"Asteroid Miner","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/asteroid-miner","authors":["Roka Josh","Thomu"],"body":"A game about blasting open asteroids with a laser, in order to get the gems inside to become the richest person in the galaxy!

Thanks a lot for checking out my game!\n\nIt's been a long time since I last joined in with a Ludum Dare - and I wasn't going to submit anything for this one, either, thanks to a busy weekend. But inspiration struck me on Sunday evening (of course!) and I just had to see if I could whip something up. Since I wasn't able to get to a computer until after midnight, this game wasn't made in 72 hours, or 48 - it was made in 24.\n\nNeedless to say, it's -very- short! I had a lot of stuff planned for it, but I decided to make something tiny and polished rather than try to cram all my ideas in. Hopefully you'll still enjoy it, even if there's barely any game to play.\n\n![Assets.png](///raw/3b5/b/z/7d7e.png)\n\nHere's a load of stuff I had ready for it, just to give you an idea of what I would have done with more time.\n\n----------------\n\nYou've woken up in a very strange place, locked in a very strange cell... So strange, in fact, that it's rocket-powered. Maybe you can find a way out?\n\n--- Controls ---\n\nUse WASD or the arrow keys to boost until you hit a block. Alternatively, click towards the edges of the screen to boost in that direction (use the background to guide you with your clicks). Be careful - you have a limited number of charges per level!\n\nRestart any stage by either clicking on the 'R' in the top-left corner or by pressing the R key. You can quit the game at any time by pressing Escape.\n\n![Screenshot 2.png](///raw/3b5/b/z/7d77.png)\n\n--- Music ---\n\nThere's no music! There was no time for it at all, I'm afraid. I suggest finding a good 8-bit/chiptune track to listen to on YouTube whilst you play. A game that allows your own music? Surely it must have the best soundtrack!\n\n--- Sound Effects ---\n\nAll of the SFX used in Cell Out! were downloaded from opengameart.org. If you want to use them too, you can find them right here: https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style\n\n--- Android Version ---\n\nIf you'd like to play on your Android device, you can download the APK file!

However the game is fairly easy to beat. With more time, there are definitely many ways to improve and expand on this game. This was also my first attempt at both making a video game and using Game Maker Studio.\n\nI wish there was music, but that concept requires a lot more discipline than i have anticipated.\n\nI am also aware that there might be a few bugs here and there that i have neglected due to a lack of time.

We didn't prioritize tasks properly and spent too much time trying to make the game look good before making a working game.

However doing that will also toggle the state of adjacent lights (all 8 neighbors). Your goal is to turn off all lights before your battery (shown at the bottom) runs out of power. Whenever your click turns off all lights, the box immediately turns on new lights for you to turn off but grants you additional battery charge for 5 more seconds!

You may only power a tile that is next to an already powered tile. A powered tile has a blue circuit underneath and usually a visible power line as well. When you have provided power to the exit node you may click the exit node to exit the level when you are ready. Starting a new level will restore a small amount of power to your pool - the only other way to increase it is to connect the power line to Power Pylons on the grid.\n\nThe contents of each level grid is generated by the game at the start of each level. The game has a difficulty curve which affects the spawn rate of certain items and how much a move costs or restores. Expect to hit more serious difficulty after level 10.\n\nCollecting points is the only way to increase your score but can be expensive in power. Try to spot a route that would take you through additional pylons. Also consider powering the exit node FIRST so if you run out of power trying to pick up other items you know you are still able to exit the level. In later levels you will want a good reserve of power to take into the next level to cope with the increased cost of building - you'll have to consider how much you want those points, really..\n\n\"Locked\" points require powering a key node before you can collect them - this can be even more expensive but they are worth a lot of points for your effort.\n\nCorruption (purple tiles) spreads as \"real time\" that passes. In early levels the additional cost to move through corruption is a mild nuisance but the further you get in the more prohibitively expensive it is to move through corruption. Corruption can not spread to powered tiles so sometimes its wise to try and cage it in. If you see corruption on the level when it starts it's certainly time to act fast and try and get that exit node powered before the corruption spreads.\n\nSome times you will be able to see that there is no way for you to complete a level with the power you have. You may press the button in the top right to restart a level with new content but it costs power to activate. It's a bit of a gamble for whether you will get a better grid next time. If you do not have enough power to restart the level then the button abandons the current play through and you will have to start again! \n\nHere is a link to a build that didn't quite make it to the 9pm deadline.

I hadn't found the time with Uni.\n\nThis game is basically a test of fire for an idea I have, project \"hope\", which is about making bullet-hell where the game knows every bullet's position at all times from (essentially) the very beginning. This allows for some funky stuff -- mostly time shenanigans.\n\n\n\n\n# Links\nGame HTML5 https://agecaf.github.io/ai-runaway/index.html\n\nSource https://github.com/Agecaf/ai-runaway\n\nCode Base https://github.com/Agecaf/studious-happiness\n\n## About the Game\nYou are an AI Overlord who decides to run away from (your position of) power. Alas, your processing power is so huge that the star drone you're escaping in is rapidly running out of power. Especially if you use your powers or lose your armor.\n\nYou can always exchange your powers for power or armor... But if you run out of powers, only fate knows what'll happen.\n\nBut what are your powers, you ask? Hmm, nothing special, just things simple like going back in time, detaching yourself from this plane of reality, warping the nature of space, and, probably the best in your arsenal, moving a bit faster.\n\n## Power Showcase\n\nWant to see how the powers look like? Or do you want to see how \"Lunatic\" is not so lunatic with the right choice of powers?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlMHpF_jk4c&t=7s\n\n*It is really when you're using powers that the theme of this ludum dare comes in.*\n\n## Easy Mode Showcase\n\nWant to see how you can do Easy mode, even without powers?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJWmDr40pL4&t=3s\n\n----\n\n\n# External Resources Used\n\n- I used my code base for project \"hope\" in html5 (https://github.com/Agecaf/studious-happiness). This contained the basic notions of poses (points with rotation and time), movements and bullets. None of the code from the demos was used, though one of the demos was used as inspiration for one of the boss' patterns.\n\n- I'm using font-awesome (http://fontawesome.io) for the icons (stars, battery) (They don't have a half-heart for some reason, which prompted the creation of our star drone).\n\n- I'm also using the Days One and the Nunito fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Days+One , https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito).\n\n# Internal Resources Created for the Game\n\n- All the art (using Inkscape and abusing the \"create stars and polygons\" tool) \n- The music [Using sunvox + kiarchive samples. I wanted to add a boss song and sfx but ran out of time :'(  ]\n- All the damn level design. It was much more work than I expected. 600 lines of grambled code.\n- All of the layout, except the canvas (taken from the codebase).\n\nI also extended the codebase with a couple of useful or important functions, most notably compoundBezier and updateAtTime. They'll be added to the codebase eventually.\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThe game itself is clearly inspired by the Touhou Project, most notably by Impossible Spellcard for it's use of powers. Some of the powers are inspired by that game (Leave Ghost <-> Doll, Fast Forward <-> Cape, Warp Edges <-> Umbrella).\n\nThough I'm not a big sonic fan, I have fond memories of my cousin playing Sonic Heroes. The music is inspired by City Escape. I started trying to play something like it, and then changed it until I had a melody I was happy with. It was appropriately named \"Night Escape\".\n\n## About Project Hope\n\nI've been toying with functional programming, and wanted to make bullet-hell games with functional ideas. This basically means that each bullet is really an object that already knows its position at all time. \n\nI then abstracted the idea that bullets are \"things that have to be rendered\" and \"things that can hit you\". So are bullet groups. So is the background (just that it never hits you). So is the text. Everything's a bullet!\n\nSo project \"hope\" is about composing building blocks to create \"functional\" bullets.\n\nThis has some benefits such as\n\n- It is really easy to make time shenanigans. Almost as simple as ```t -= dt;```\n- It is easy to reason about your patterns (\"It's bullet range with N bullets which are this sprite with linear movement...\")\n\nBut also some drawbacks such as\n\n- It is much harder to do time-step things such as player-centered gravity.\n- It is much harder to do \"bombs\", i.e. selecting bullets by area and removing them. This also holds for \"killing enemies\".\n\nProject \"hope\" has had three iterations, the first in Scala with libgdx, the second in javascript with HTML5, and the third (work in progress) in Lua with LÖVE.\n\nI'm favoring the Lua version since I wanted to make it \"moddable\" (i.e. just pop in a file and get a level, possibly with the whole game changed), and Scala just has a horrible compile time, whereas in lua it's a breeze. \n\nScala's syntax and typechecks are just beautiful, so I might rework the Scala project to make it only for non-moddable games.\n\nThe HTML5 version is there mainly so that I have an online demo. It desperately needs changes to help with typechecks etc."},{"id":40227,"event":"jam","name":"Uninterruptible Power","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/uninterruptible-power","authors":["DarkXolotl","Mawesome"],"body":"After my team left me at the middle of the event, I just had to make something.

In order to reach their destination, they must make use of their stored reserves of power to run the life support and other ship systems in order to defend against threats like stellar storms and radiation fields.\n\nThere's no music, but consider playing this in the background: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mHf0cKPU5g\n\n![numbers.png](///raw/30d/2/z/5f0c.png)\n\n1.

Crew members in cryostasis take less power to keep alive.\n* **Engine Room:** Man the Engine Room to increase the _Indefatigable_'s speed. Each additional crew member makes the ship faster and more efficient in its power usage.\n* **Life Support:** Man Life Support to decrease the power usage per active crew member.\n* **Medical Bay:** Man the Medical Bay with a healthy crew member to heal an injured crew member in the Medical bay. Injured crew members will worsen and eventually die outside the Medical Bay.\n* **Missile Control:** Man Missile Control to destroy hostile fighters attacking the ship.\n* **Scanner Array:** Man the Scanner Array to increase the range at which oncoming crises are detected.\n* **Shield Gens:** Man the Shield Gens to decrease the damage taken from stellar storms.\n* **Warp Control:** Man Warp Control to build warp charge. When the warp charge is full, the _Indefatigable_ can jump forward to skip past crises. When nobody is manning warp control, warp charge will decay, so watch out!\n\n## Crises\n\n* **Stellar storm:** A storm hits the _Indefatigable_, costing power to maintain the shields. Each crew member manning Shield Gens reduces the power loss.\n* **Radiation field:** Radiation hits up to three ship positions, injuring any crew members there. Each crew member manning Life Support reduces the number of positions hit.\n* **Hostile fighters:** Hostile fighters attack the _Indefatigable_, costing energy to fend off. Any hostiles that aren't destroyed will return and attack again. Each crew member manning Missile Control destroys hostile fighters when they attack.\n* **Heat wave:** A heat wave disrupts the cryostasis modules, killing any crew members in cryostasis.\n* **Spatial flux:** Spacetime anomalies require warp charge to weather. The _Indefatigable_ is destroyed unless Warp Control is manned with at least 15% warp charge. All members crewing Warp Control are injured.\n* **Black hole:** The gravitational pull of the black hole captures and consumes all that come too close.

Each player controls one of the rabbits and each rabbit holds controls part of the flying drone: one player aims and the other shoots. It's meant to be played by two players side by side, one using the keyboard and the other the mouse. The controls are in the title screen.\n\nI wanted to copy the Bungee Buddies minigame from WarioWare: Smooth Moves and add some things into the mix. The idea was to make a game for two players using a single Wiimote-Nunchuk. After a few hours, I realized I was going to spend the entire weekend messing with technical stuff and that even if I succeeded, most of my potential players don't own a Wiimote and a bit of effort is required to connect one to your PC (at least on Windows).\n\nSo, I dropped the idea of having the players physically jump. And for the compo, I decided to have it use the keyboard and mouse.\n\nI think it's interesting, but I didn't quite nail it. Despite having spent most of Sunday creating and balancing the difficulty progression, I feel it's too easy for me, so it's ultimately kind of boring. It could definitely use more content, too.\n\nWhat I learned from making this is that, for this type of game, you need to carefully consider your restraints for generating obstacles. The biggest difficulty I had was with the energy: energy is health and ammo in this game, so how much energy the players receive is what affects the balance most. You need to make sure the game doesn't become unreasonable at any point, but if you don't design your game correctly, it becomes very hard to make sure it's neither too easy nor too hard. I get the feel that there's some crucial design change I need to make to avoid this problem.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading! I hope you have fun with the game!\n\nUPDATE: You can now customize your controls.\n\n\n![start.png](///raw/512/z/61d9.png)\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/512/z/61db.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/512/z/61df.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/512/z/61e5.png)\n"},{"id":43908,"event":"compo","name":"SpaceDrain","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/spacedrain","authors":["NekuSoul"],"body":"![PICO-8_0.gif](///raw/b06/3/z/58fe.gif)\n\n## Play here (Web)\n\nItch.io page: https://nekusoul.itch.io/spacedrain\n\n## Description\n\nMade with PICO-8.\n\nYour energy core is defect and slowly running out of energy.

We implemented waves of enemies that would follow you and fire various weapons at you before you face a final boss (yes it's a little cliché, but we couldn't resist).\n\n**There are 3 control modes:** (Accessed in the pause menu through the escape key)\n - Mouse Controls - Where the mouse controls rotation and WASD control movement relative to that.\n - Keyboard Controls - Where the A and D controls rotation and WSQE control movement relative to that.\n - Absolute Controls - Where the mouse controls rotation, but the ship moves according to the WASD keys absolutely (so W is always up).\n\nThe balance of the game is not entirely perfect, and it is lacking polish in some areas (such as the obvious omittance of an animation when a laser beam hit's something), but overall we're very pleased to say that it is our first game.\n\nWe hope you have fun playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.\n\n\n![Screenshot_0.png](///raw/a8b/8/z/8364.png)\n\n\n![Screenshot_2.png](///raw/a8b/8/z/8365.png)\n\n\n![Screenshot_1_Cropped.png](///raw/a8b/8/z/8368.png)\n\n\n**Change Log**\n - Fixed an issue with the instruction screen's scaling.\n - Set the default controls for the player to Absolute because people seemed to be confused by Mouse Controls.\n - Fixed the boss shock-wave effect because it was repeating indefinitely as opposed to only playing once."},{"id":35956,"event":"jam","name":"Rat Hole City","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/rat-hole-city","authors":["MrChippy"],"body":"In Rat Hole City you go around in tunnels and run away from buggaboos(bugs).

Thanks in advance.\n\n### Gameplay Question\nI'm seeing several comments about the handling of the ship being hard, or the controls being difficult. I've played this in 4 different browsers in 3 different operating systems, and it appears to behave as I'm expecting.  If you experience something odd, please describe in as much detail as you can what you feel is wrong and I will see what I can do to address it in the evolution build.\n\n### Known issues:\n- Enemy ships spawn randomly inside the game field, which results in unavoidable collisions some times.\n- Random seed isn't random yet.\n- Physics engine has an issue when exported to HTML5 as best I can tell.  Had to reduce thrust to very low levels to make it playable in web interface, which makes it too slow to be viable in CTF.\n- If you shoot at overlapping enemies, one of the dropped energy pods scales wrong and is stuck in one spot\n\n### Roadmap for the future:\n- Add additional power-ups.\n- Improve enemy logic (enemies avoid colliding with each other, ie: no overlap)\n- Add tractor beam to collect energy pods rather than colliding with them.\n- Add music\n- Add animations (engines, ships exploding, maybe slight parallax in the background)\n- Power bar on ship?\n- Score breakdown on game over screen\n- Add additional enemies (tougher enemies)\n- Add enemy combat functions (shooting, mines, etc)\n- Possibly convert the game to a panning view rather than a static screen with warping\n- Add a mobile port\n- ???\n\n### 2 August 2017 Notes\nThank you everyone for the amazing feedback.  It's really great to hear the suggestions and comments.  Ironically, many of the suggestions being made are things I already have planned for the game but just didn't have time to get done during the Compo.  I have already started adding a few things which you can find at the link below.  The main HTML5 (Web) link at the bottom is still the one to use for rating the game.  All in all this has been a great experience and I'm already hyped and looking forward to the next Ludum Dare.\n\nDO NOT RATE ME ON THE FOLLOWING LINK\n\n#### POST EVENT UPDATE: http://www.spetsdod.com/ld39-evolution\n\nThis is where I will continue to add in new features after the event.\n#### Added:\n- High Energy Pod Drop from random enemy ships\n- Updated Start screen with scoring changes\n- Fixed random seed so ships should appear more randomly now (still spawning in the playfield - haven't fixed that yet)"},{"id":33890,"event":"jam","name":"Energy Thief","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/energy-thief-1","authors":["Fireshake"],"body":"Help the little Energy Thief to steal the batteries, but be aware of the FROGMEN!\n\nYou have 500 seconds!\n\nClick Play to start!\n![wanted.png](///raw/d02/8/z/7e39.png)\n\nControls:\n\nArrows--Move\n\n(Play in fullscreen-mode for the best experience)\n![screenshot_20170801_035344.png](///raw/d02/8/z/7cfb.png)\n\n\nFix: \n\nFixed the Sound-Volume\n    \n   Fixed the Camera-Zoom\n\n\n"},{"id":33998,"event":"jam","name":"Zone Slayer","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/zone-slayer","authors":["mmason","Growlands"],"body":"# WEB - https://mmason.itch.io/zone-slayer\n\n![ZoneSlayerFullNes.png](///raw/778/z/7753.png)\n\nFinally, after 26 years of development, the totally awesome sequel to ZONE ENFORCER has arrived!

I bet Mojo Badly's up to his old tricks again.\"\n\nSo you go to the garage and patch up Sparky to go make road pizza of these goons. But oh dang, Sparky's internal battery is acting all whack. But he ain't no scrub, he's going to go tell that nerd to cram it back to Grief Mountain again.\n\nMeanwhile you can sit back, order in a pizza and open a \"cold one.\"\n\n# controls\n\n* XBox controller support\n* keyboard support with additional mouse controls\n\n## Keyboard\n* W/S Up/Down - Move Sparky forwards and backwards\n* A/D Left/Right - turn Sparky left and right\n* L-CTRL - Shoot Sparky's Electro-Blaster (careful this uses your power!)\n* L-ALT - Use Sparky's Vibro-Saw to hack those zombies apart (this should work if you fullscreen the game)\n\n## X-Box Controller\n* D-Pad Up/Down - Move Sparky forwards and backwards\n* D-Pad Left Right - turn Sparky left and right\n* A - Shoot Sparky's Electro-Blaster (careful this uses your power!)\n* B - Use Sparky's Vibro-Saw to hack those zombies apart\n\n## Mouse\n* Left Click - Shoot Sparky's Electro-Blaster (careful this uses your power!)\n* Right Click - Use Sparky's Vibro-Saw to hack those zombies apart\n\nApologies in advance for people who a non-English keyboard configuration\n\n# Credit\n\n#### Font\nArcade Classic Font by: Pizzadude - http://www.1001freefonts.com/arcade_classic.font\nFree for personal use\n\n#### Music\n\"Cyborg Ninja\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\"Mega Hyper Ultrastorm\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\"Voltaic\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n#### Sounds\n[bxfr](http://www.bfxr.net/)"},{"id":34649,"event":"jam","name":"3% | Power Saver","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/3-power-saver","authors":["iseeicy"],"body":"![CoverLarge.png](///raw/1ce/z/775d.png)\n\n## Description\n\nIn *3% | Power Saver*, you find yourself at an indoor mall with only 3% charge left on your phone.

Although a centillion years is quite a good run for a universe, there is yet another law of nature that states, “Life always seeks a way keep on living.” This is evident in the evolution of a species over time. Animals adapt to rapid, dramatic environmental changes; Plants always eventually find their way through cracks in the concrete, despite all odds.\n\nEven so, by now, most of the sentient life has died out. Their stars over time have burned up all of their helium, and collapsed into grand displays of supernovae. All that remains are densely-packed neutron stars and foreboding black holes dotting the otherwise vacant landscape.\n\nThe younger and less intelligent races were the first to go, not having yet discovered the technology to reach out to neighboring star systems. Those who had failed to master the art of sustained nuclear fusion soon followed. Eventually, the most advanced races became desperate for power, forsaking peace agreements with more vulnerable populations to absorb their resources in a desperate attempt at self-preservation.\n\n\nWar now ravages the universe, as the most technologically advanced species’ gamble their final energy supplies in an attempt to strip each other of what few resources remain.\n\n**Life is tenacious.** \n\nThe Sakari of the Aneurin system, especially so. A highly technologically advanced and predominantly peaceful race, they had long-since predicted this outcome. Instead of waging war, they opted to close their borders and direct their energy into bolstering their defenses in an attempt to protect that which is most precious to them - The Trans-Universal Warp Drive, a device that will allow them to explore the multiverse. \n\nDevelopment has almost concluded, but unfortunately not quickly enough. The Sakari have used up the majority of their reserves trying to safely sustain their population, leaving nothing to spare to power the device, the last hope of the universe. With no other options left, they installed the drive onto their most capable ship, The Starseeker, and sent it off into the unknown.\n\nThe fate of Sakari, of the universe itself, rests in the collective hands of the crew of The Starseeker.

A battery must be plugged into the console before you can play!\n2. The bouncing green circle charges batteries that it touches!\n3. Press the power button to turn on the console!\n4. **The button on the left toggles the backlight, the one on the right toggles sound!**\n5. Having one toggled on doubles the battery's usage, tripled if both are on!\n6. AD to move, W to jump, **S to use your shield**!\n7. The shield makes you impervious to damage, but you are unable to move for half a second!\n8. Save points save your progress; make sure you touch them, or you'll have to do over!\n9. Death floors will activate randomly, listen out for the cue!\n10. Sawblades blend in well with the background, keep the backlight on! Or you can squint real hard, that's okay too.\n11. Ghosts randomly appear after you obtain the battery; kill them with your shield!\n12. Your time score is calculated EVEN WHEN THE GAME IS OFF. Getting a good score means managing your batteries properly!\n13. **After obtaining the battery at the end of the level, you must travel back to the start of the level where the teleporter awaits!** \n\n**======================================**\n\n**Tools:**\n\n- GraphicsGale - Pixel art\n- bfxr.net - Sound effects\n- fakemusicgenerator.com - Randomly generated music\n- GXSCC - Coverting Midi to 8bit\n- Audacity - Cropping audio\n- Game Maker Studio - Game engine\n\n**=====================================**"},{"id":44936,"event":"compo","name":"Pokkie","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/pokkie","authors":["tijmentio"],"body":"![pokkie_screen2.png](///raw/91a/1/z/62af.png)\n\nYou're at a party; you're bored.\n\nSatirical game about smartphone OS's and our day to day use of them.\n"},{"id":45837,"event":"jam","name":"Speedy Security ","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/speedy-security","authors":["JacazzaJade"],"body":"My first Ludum Dare!

If you input **HELP** you get a list of commands.\n\nTo acquire power to feed the Cosmic AC:\n1. **JUMP** to a planet\n2. find a laptop or fusion core (use the **RENDER** command to get a first person view)\n3. bring a drone with a *CABLE* to a laptop, or a *FUSION REACTOR* to a fusion core, and use the **DRAIN** command while facing it\n4. **JUMP** back to the home forge\n5. use **DEPOSIT** to transfer power from your drone to the AC\n\n\n**Some other notes**\n - drones with a *REFUELER* can be used to move power to and from drones. This is useful if your drone is stuck with no power. Just send a refueler to it. Use the **TRANSFER** command, with a positive or negative value.\n - drones with a *GRABBER* can **PICKUP** laptops and fusion cores, and **JUMP** with them, but must **DROP** them before other drones can use them.\n - a drone with a *HAMMER* can **CRUSH** a drained laptop or fusion core. A drone with a fusion reactor can then **DRAIN** additional power from the wreck.\n - use **INSPECT** when facing any object to learn how much power it stores.\n\n**Now on to the description.**\n\nFeels like every other game I make I'm happy with, and the rest are kinda shit. This one feels kinda shit, sorry about that.\n\nGame's inspired, and features, Asimov's short story \"The Last Question\". All audio is ultimately created by me, but if you feel that I shouldn't be entering the Compo with the text of a cult science fiction story, then feel free to rate things as though it wasn't there.\n\nI don't know if it's possible to beat the game, I didn't have the time to check because I was staring at my digestive tract for the last 6 hours of the compo, attempting to set it on fire with my eyes so it'd be less painful.\n\nEnjoy or something. I dunno.\n\n[Also there's a postLD version which I recommend using](http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/39/postLD/win86_LastQuestion_postLD.zip)(\n[Win](http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/39/postLD/win86_LastQuestion_postLD.zip), \n[*Nix](http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/39/postLD/nix86_LastQuestion_postLD.zip), \n[OSX](http://amras.dowolnanazwa.pl/ludumdare/39/postLD/osx86_LastQuestion_postLD.zip)).

Your task is simple, survive as long as possible. But environment in this game is'nt much friendly. You must eat for hinder hunger, heat yourself for prevent freeze in cold night, and lastly defend yourself before zombies, who are wake up at night. Peace time (day) is limited, every day you must prepare for night, make some supplies for next deadly night.\n\n\n**How I make animation and player ?**\nAnswer is very simple, I make a very simple 3D model of player and weapons with sceleton, and create simple animations for it. Run throug Unity3D and bake these animations into sprites with weapons and wtihout them (there are around 200 sprites for this animations in sheet :) Thanx god for automate tools which helps me with converting from 3D to 2D sprite)\n\n\n# How to play ?\n\n- 1) You must watch your stats (power), if your heat or hunger go under 0, you will start dying.\n- 2) Day have 2 minutes, and every night (60 seconds), will come zombies in wave, there are also cold so you need warm with campfire and fight with zombies.\n- 3) For better weapons and tools you must mine stone and wood\n- 4) For decrease hunger, you need pick food from bushes and eat it\n- 5) Every tool and weapon can be upgraded, but you can carry only one so you must switch between them by click on specific item (not just buy it)\n\n# Controlls\n* Movement: [W][A][S][D] or arrow keys\n* Attack/mine: [SPACE_BAR]\n* Eat: Hit eat button\n* Buy item: Hit plus button on items\n* Switch item: Hit icon in inventory\n\n\n# Tools:\n**Axe**\n![axe.jpg](///raw/225/z/6676.jpg)\nBasic tool for quicker mine wood and stone, it can't be use for attack, you will attack as free hand.\n\n\n**Knife**\n![knife.jpg](///raw/225/z/6673.jpg)\n\nFirst attack weapon, power is poor, but you can survive few nights only with this knife.\n\n**Sword**\n![sword.jpg](///raw/225/z/6674.jpg)\nAdvanced weapon for mid game, without upgraded sword, you can't survive for more then 5 days. \n\n**Battle axe**\n![battleaxe.jpg](///raw/225/z/6675.jpg)\nThis weapon looks so cool, and it's also very powerfull, fully upgraded battle axe will destroy every zombie wave.\n\n# Out of time \n(48 hour is not much, but I not want submit in JAM):\n- More sounds (footsteps, zombie hit, zombie dead, player hit, campfire)\n- Whole tutorial \"room\"\n- More environment props (trunks, stones, flowers)\n- Thirst state, player must drink from well\n- Better balancing (item price, item damage, zombie wave and damage)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n- 31.7. 11:50 CET - Fixed very easy gameplay with cold, its almost not challanging (maybe it require more balancing for better difficulty) - https://github.com/hadikcz/LudumDare39_Last_survivor/commit/e19de07b9d195462a70fe4445292a360314f8a03\n- 1.8. 23:17 CET -  Double food bush count, for easy difficulty -\n https://github.com/hadikcz/LudumDare39_Last_survivor/commit/82feaeb148b2fadd02a2bf3268e03e8574dc0f3c\n\n\n## Screens and gameplay\n\n[Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIdfBUCN_kg)\n\n![screen.jpg](///raw/225/z/667d.jpg)\n\n![Screenshot_2.jpg](///raw/225/z/667e.jpg)\n\n![Screenshot_15.jpg](///raw/225/z/6680.jpg)"},{"id":33360,"event":"jam","name":"Photon Phury","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/photon-phury","authors":["PanC4k3","EvangaLa13","Oyianakis"],"body":"A nihilistic robot seeks death.

The intro goes on for longer than expected so pop the kettle on and get comfy.\n\n*The audio is a little quiet as we didn't get time to master it. We will fix this as soon as we can stomach looking at Unity again. In the meantime turn your speakers up!*\n\nAll content created in 72 hours except for 2 pieces of music, which we did write but were written prior to the jam.  \n\nWe hope you enjoy it!\n\n![SHM4.png](///raw/38c/2/z/8248.png)\n![SHM 2.png](///raw/38c/2/z/8244.png)\n![SHM3.png](///raw/38c/2/z/8246.png)\n\nSuper Helpful Man is our 8th Ludum Dare game based on our adventure game framework.

Playing time is around 5-15 minutes.\nThere are only 2 resources in this game:\n\n- Metal\n- Energy\n\nBoth can be obtained from the (many) asteroids that you can find around the base.\nThis game cannot be \"win\", at some point you will either be overwhelmed by the enemies or you will run out of resources to extract.\nThe objective of the game is to gather as much metal as possible, while not dying under the pressure of the enemies.\n\n# Privacy disclaimer\nYour score will be submitted to a database, in which you'll be able to compare with the rest of the players.\nThe server was coded during ludum dare and is currently hosted at my home, so it could go offline some times :smile:.\n\n\n# Important\n- Start by building METAL extractor, as if you run out of it, you cannot build extractors anymore \n  (yes, it would need a good rebalance, but I didn't know how to fix it without setting the cost to 0 (suggestions are welcome!). TL;DR: **Don't run out of metal or you'll not be able to build anything else**.\n- When you run out of energy for too long you will still lose the game. There's no visual indication of this! If you don't hear turrets shooting then you have a problem with energy.\n- You need to be paying attention closely to the energy level (or the amount of energy asteroids you are mining, when you are later in the game), as without energy the turrets cannot shoot...\n\n### Tips\n- Resources run out, you need to expand to stay alive, but expanding also increases your defenses requirements...\n- Enemy kills count towards the score.\n- if you use the same name your score will be REPLACED with the new one. You may go forward in the ladder, but you may also go back and worsen your score.\n- the map is generated randomly (even though the number of asteroids is the same). You could find a map easier than another.\n- The enemies are not intelligent at all, they just attack the nearest structure. They plan to win by overwhelming you with sheer numbers!\n- Pay attention to enemy formations. At late stage their numbers become dangerous!\n\n### Original ideas that I didn't implement due time constraints:\n- Originally I wanted this game to have a power network like creeper world (look it up! It's an excellent game!) and a more interesting distribution of the asteroids (a bit more clustered - to force the player putting weak spots /links between the clusters), but there was really no time to get it up in time.\n- I also wanted some more variety both in structures and enemies, but I already found it a bit challenging to reach an acceptable balance with the only enemy that is there, so adding more was out of the question.\n\n# Update: Web version, Mac & Linux\nAdded web version, mac and linux versions here: https://supercrunchy.itch.io/the-infinite-mine\n\nWe still ** highly reccomend using the native version**\n\nHere are few disadvantages of the web version:\n- It's not able to post the scores to the web server due to CORS being disable on the server (for the moment - until I enable it)\n- It runs very slowly, especially when the enemy starts getting up to some big numbers.\n\n"},{"id":34817,"event":"compo","name":"Electron","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/electron-my-first-jam-d","authors":["Luis Garcia"],"body":"Phew, barely made it\n\nYou play as an electron that tries to avoid running out of power.\nYou also dodge other particles.\n\nTools used:\n* Unity\n* Visual Studio\n* Photoshop\n* Bosca Ceoil\n* Bfxr\n\nI think there's a problem with the source code link, so [here's another](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B455FL9LBaQXVi1nQmNsTHhxc0k?usp=sharing)\n\nArcade, quick, bad music, etc"},{"id":34839,"event":"compo","name":"No Power-Got Juice?","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/no-juice-got-juice","authors":["ethanyqc"],"body":"Hey What's up\n\nThis is a little desktop game I created for Compo, build with Unity. \n\nThe main character Cuby has only a single bar of battery left.

Find the flying ores, craft wires, discover the power crystals and connect them to the ship. Help Ted escaping that weird planet!!!\n\n**Read the How To play, the game is not very intuitive**\n\n## Controls:\n\n- WASD to move\n- E to interact\n- ScrollWhell for zoom\n\n## How to Play:\n\n- You start beside your ship in a hexagonal grid. When you move the grid will start to uncover.\n- Your first mission is to find a flying ore, you will notice them for the brown hex.\n\n**This is how the ores look like, go to them and pres E to mine them**\n![Ore.JPG](///raw/a70/8/z/851b.jpg)\n- After you get enough resources from ores, you can go back to the ship and craft wires. (4 Cooper + 1 Prismalite = 1 Wire, 4 Copper + 1 Zetthyst = 4 wires)\n\n**This is how your ship looks like, go to it and press E to craft wires**\n![Sjip.JPG](///raw/a70/8/z/851c.jpg)\n- Now that you are armed with wires, it's time to find a Power crystal, they are fairly rare, you will notice them for the yellow hex.\n- When you spot a crystal, several blue hex will appear showing you where you can place the wires.\n\n**This is how a crystal looks like, and the blue hex shows you were you can place wires. Place them with E**\n![Crystal.JPG](///raw/a70/8/z/851e.jpg)\n- Place wires until you get to your ship. Place them with E but think before you do it, if the path to the ship is too long, energy will be lost.\n\n**This is how your wire will look after you place them**\n![Wire.JPG](///raw/a70/8/z/851f.jpg)\n- You can also join a wire to a previous existing path.\n- Remember, power crystal doesn't hold unlimited power.\n- If you are capable of powering the ship before the guys that were following you arrive, you'll be free.\n\n## Tips and tricks:\n\n- Always keep moving, you need to find ores and power crystals quickly.\n- As soon as you are able to craft wires, head to the ship and do it.\n- Connect the new paths to already existing ones, saves wires and time.\n- Search in a radial pattern, if you go too far away from the ship you will lose time returning for cables.\n- **The game has a lot of random variables when creating the map.** It can be really easy or really hard. I didn't had much time to tune this. So if you lose and feel the game didn't give you enough resources, try again and hope the odds are better next time.\n\n## Soundtrack: \n\nThe game has 2 songs composed by me one for the menu screen and the main theme. The main theme has two versions, an acoustic that plays when the game starts and an electric version that starts when you get closer to winning.\n\n[YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTxY1L-05nHTWcYxYygeO8QL2ErEJe-5)\n\n## Some words:\n\nIt's my first time in a game jam and I surprise myself with the result. It's far from perfect, but to think I could do it in 72 hours blows my mind. \nI design the game, wrote all the code and compose the music. The main character is also my design, but all other models are taken from free resource packs in the Unity Asset Store.\n\n## Thanks to:\n\n- My brother for supporting me in all my ambitious (unfinished) projects.\n- My girlfriend for just supporting me in life and loving me with all her heart.\n- My dad for recording the sax part in the \"Electric\" theme of the song and remind me that I was against a clock.\n- And my mom too...for being there.\n\nI await your comments.\n"},{"id":39120,"event":"jam","name":"Unlit","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/unlit","authors":["xdegtyarev"],"body":"Light is fading.

I haven't really planned out the weekend around Ludum Dare, so I've had some interruptions (both internal and external). Things that are missing and I might put in a new version after LD finishes:\n\n- Enemies. Currently the game doesn't have any, and it might introduce more tension if it did. It does need whole lot of new systems to have a space fleet battle work properly, and that had to be cut early on.\n- Music. While I can draw and I can figure out bfxr enough to produce some sounds, making music is just something I cannot try doing and expect the result not to summon Cthulhu if played. \n- Ship actions. This was the hardest thing for me to cut, because I still think it should be included, but there's only so much time I have. The player was supposed to be able to transfer fuel and passengers between ships in the fleet, which would enable to abandon ships with as less damage as possible, which would make for much more interesting gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately for the Central Europe timezone, Ludum Dare is not a very good fit - it starts and ends at 3 in the morning, and I have to go to work on Monday, so I can't stay up that long. This already shaves half a day, and I still need to sleep, code, eat, and try to have a life if possible.

My level generator was generating jups that were too far to make without any powerups, so i thought it would be clever to have a super-jump to make them. However, this is too much of a new feature, so i removed it. I DID fix my generator, so that jumps that look too far should now have a ladder - this was originally intended but the ladder did not actually extend farther than the hole it was coming from, making the jump impossible.

Stronger ministers can more easily assassinate other ministers, or assassinate you. You can use the Minister of Intelligence to assassinate other ministers, but only if he likes you more than he likes them. You can also ask for a specific action from each of them, for instance the minister of production will use resources to provide satiation. This action will also decrease their approval of you.\n\nBe careful if all the ministers have positive opinions with each other, as they may gang up to defeat you.\n\nEvents may occur throughout the game, and you must respond to them in order to move on to the next turn/week.\nEssentially everything in the game has a tooltip, so hover over things if you're not sure.\n\n### Theme\nThe theme was running out of power, so I chose to interpret that as a dictatorship running out of (political) power. No dictators were harmed in the making of this game.\n\n### Notes\nUnfortunately, I didn't have time (have school) or skill to make audio, so this is a soundless game for now. It's my fifth Ludum Dare, and my first time making a game entirely with web (without using Phaser or any game library). Didn't really have time to make a tutorial either. Runs best in Google Chrome.

Due to the invention of new energy sources, all coal power plants were shut down. But there were tiny (but more than relevant) faults in the new power plants. Now the energy of the world is running low. The first action, the government announced, was to shut down every electronic robot until a solution will be found. The robots which developed an self-learning AI over the years, of course hate the idea of being shut down, so they turned off their wireless control units and resist the government. They became hostile to every human nearing them.\n\nNow, you appear on the plan. You are an old coal-driven robot and thus are no danger to the critical power situation of the world. Your job now, is to shut down every electronic robot you can find.\n\n![Day Three 2017-08-01T02-57.png](///raw/c31/z/77c3.png)\n\n### Gameplay\nIn this game you have to shut down every robot to save the world. You have to sneak past those robots and try not to be discovered.\n\nYou can move by rightclicking on tiles. You interact with objects in the same way. The camera is moveable with WSAD.  Press R to restart a level and ESC to exit to the main menu.\n\nIf you have problems with a level, you can skip it by using the level selection in the main menu.\n\n\n### Technical Details\nThe game was made in Java using libGDX (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). I made all the graphics myself with the tool MagicaVoxel (https://ephtracy.github.io/). The background music was made using LMMS (https://lmms.io/).

It would be nice if you do that ! :heart:\n\n\n### **================================ :thinking: What is it ?**\n\n**Who are you ? Why are you here ?** ​You don't know it. However, you know that you **don't have enough power to leave this new planet** you've discovered and you'r stuck here. The only thing you can do is to **serve other magical girls** in order to get more power, and leave this nightmare... Or stay here forever.\n\n\n### **================================ :point_down: How to play ?**\n\nRight click on clients to interact with them. It's as simple as that.

It depends of their tastes - and who knows the exact tastes of everyone he just met ?)\n\n\n### **================================ :muscle: Bug fixed since the first publication**\n\n- :rainbow: Fixed colors (somes clients had the same color as other elements (background), now you should see them correctly !)\n- :point_up: Fixed ending text (there is 5 endings and not only 2 : 3 bad endings and 2 \"good\" endings)\n- :coffee: Fixed client's tastes (giving every clients just a hot chocolate made them happy ! There were missing a condition to check if they totaly like the meal or not...)\n- :eyes: Fixed client's panel (you could click on a client, talk with him, close, re-open the window and them talk with him again. Same with baking meal. Now you can't cheat by doing this, sorry !)\n- :raised_hand: Fixed dialogue speed (if you don't want to read what you should read)\n\nAlso keep in mind that you must RIGHT click on clients !! Left click on them will do... Nothing.\n\n(please note that only the webgl version is bug-fixed, other versions (windows, windows x 64, mac os x and linux) are not bug-fixed !!)\n\n### **================================ :nerd: Tool used**"},{"id":36309,"event":"compo","name":"Tiny Sub Mission","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/tiny-sub-mission","authors":["Meta-link"],"body":"***Description comming soon***\n\n![Capture d'écran 2017-07-31 01.59.31.png](///raw/ba4/z/67a0.png)\n\n![Capture d'écran 2017-07-31 01.59.35.png](///raw/ba4/z/67a1.png)\n\n![Capture d'écran 2017-07-31 02.00.25.png](///raw/ba4/z/67a2.png)\n\n![Capture d'écran 2017-07-31 02.02.34.png](///raw/ba4/z/67a3.png)\n\n![Capture d'écran 2017-07-31 02.02.50.png](///raw/ba4/z/67a4.png)\n\nWebGL version available for any OS **(but prefer standalone if you can)** !\n\nControls : arrow keys and spacebar to move, W to charge and launch"},{"id":36358,"event":"jam","name":"Running out of Sugar","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/running-out-of-sugar","authors":["Natrium729"],"body":"![running-out-of-sugar-title.png](///raw/7bb/1/z/793e.png)\n\nHelp me!\n\nI need more sugar or else I won't have the energy to finish my game for the Ludum Dare!\n\nAll I need to do is to eat the food falling down.

A lot of energy is required to keep Ludum Dare working and you don't want her to run out of it, do you? For this reason, she recruited you to get the souls of your fellow programmers, artists and designers which she feeds on.\n\nThat's right, you have to slay your way through the Ludum Dare community.\n\nYou impersonate a great, bearded and four-eyed man which must kill the goblins (which are the impersonations of your fellows, interesting choice) so that Ludum Dare can get the souls she needs. Ludum Dare is impersonated by a beautiful and hard-to-get witch, that helps you with a magic shield. However, keeping the shield activated consumes souls, so you may want to gather them fast. Beware, staying outside of the shield will lower your health because of the toxicity of the dungeon (goblins pollute their environment too). Goblins can't go through the shield, so you may want to fight them from inside of it and to go outside just to explorate the dungeon. Throughout the dungeon, you may find some ruins which have powerups for you. You can take them by dragging and dropping them on the two slots in the lower part of the screen. Be careful with powerups, since they consume souls each time you activate them. The witch will stay still unless you tell her to follow you.\n\nControls:\n- WASD: player movement;\n- left mouse button click: player attack;\n- Q and E: activation of powerups, if taken;\n- SPACE: witch follows you;\n- ESC: pause the game.\n\nIntro:\n![intro.png](///raw/d82/9/z/6b07.png)\n\nIn game:\n![lots1.png](///raw/d82/9/z/6b0b.png)\n\nPowerups:\n![pu.png](///raw/d82/9/z/6b0d.png)"},{"id":39027,"event":"jam","name":"The Breach","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/the-breach","authors":["rela_x","Senfer","Vlad Chechyotkin"],"body":"![screen.png](///raw/178/9/z/82a9.png)\n\n![demo.gif](///raw/691/3/z/6d7a.gif)\n\n>Power shortage, robots, evil virus in a lab IN SPACE! ** > [Play in browser]( https://yunatan.github.io/) < **\n\n## CONTROLS: \n- A D / Left Right - movement;\n- Space - jump;\n- LeftMouseButton / LeftCTRL - attack;\n- ESC - hard reset.\n\n## Gameplay:\n\n### I highly recommend reading all of this.

An unpowered turret is dead. You can get power by collecting batteries spawned by the synthesizer at periodic intervals. Keep collecting them to have a larger power bank!\n- Scrap is used to speed up battery generation from synthesizers, and to revive unpowered turrets. Scrap is left by dead enemies.\n- Turrets shoot on their own and lose power continuously even if they are not being attacked. You need to recharge them continuously. For turrets, power = health.\n- Once all turrets are powered down, enemies start attacking the core.

Once you click *start*, tabs will appear at the bottom that open different screens which give you an overview of your kingdom and let you invade other countries.\n\nThe first tab lets you control your homeland and look at its stats (though none of the actions work due to a bug). The **Population** tab gives you a quick rundown of how your population is split. The **Colonies** tab shows up once you've explored and colonised some land, and lets you manage colonies. **Resources** (one of the first tabs, and one of the most polished/functional) gives you an overview of your kingdom's stored resources and yearly yield and cost. **Explore** shows you all the lands in the game and lets you take land, giving you a rundown of what resources they hold and how many men you'll need to send in order to take the land. Once you've clicked on an action button, the \"Next\" button should show up and you'll be able to move on to the next year. You can perform up to 4 actions a day, and the rest will be put on hold until the next year.\n\nNote that to expand some options and menus you'll need to ensure you click on the actual text, not just the coloured box, and there is no mobile support, so it's recommended to use a desktop browser.

(Control him using the \"WASD\" keys)\n![Screenshot_7.png](///raw/91e/7/z/78a1.png)\n\n\n\nAs the Captain you get to control robots.\nEach robot has a battery, when it dies the robot dies\n![Screenshot_8.png](///raw/91e/7/z/78cf.png)\n\n\n\nOn you right is your system power bar, \n![Screenshot_9.png](///raw/91e/7/z/791d.png)\n\n\n\nYou can left click it (up to 3 times) to get a transfer battery which you can use by **right-clicking** on **robots**.\nWhen robots are right-clicked, one power bar gets refilled (Power can be lost if refilling full batteries **right-click anywhere that isn't a robot to put power back into the system **).\n![UIAzE9rins.gif](///raw/91e/7/z/7a2a.gif)\n\n\n\nRobots can be sent to work stations by **left-clicking** on the **robot** and **right-clicking** on the **station** (Stations light up green when hovered above while robots light up when selected).\n![lveO8QqwVo.gif](///raw/91e/7/z/7a93.gif)\n\n\n\nRobots give an icon from time to time. A robot will only do a task matching this icon (For example, an engine icon means a robots will only work on the engine);\n![Screenshot_10.png](///raw/91e/7/z/79c0.png)\n\n\n\nIf a robot with the matching icon is standing at its station, the station will charge up.\n![DHcYbohAQE.gif](///raw/91e/7/z/7b3e.gif)\n\n\nIf you want to change the icon to the station the robot is currently at (To keep it charging) you can use the screwdriver (**bottom left!**) to play a minigame and convince the robot.\n![minigame (0).gif](///raw/91e/7/z/7c83.gif)\n\n\n\nThis game gets harder the more a robot works. **To reset a robot's minigame difficulty, you must send it to an entertainment station**. The room is split into 2 sides, the left are the entertainment stations. (Entertainment stations in red, work stations in blue).\n![Screenshot_11.png](///raw/91e/7/z/7d19.png)\n\n\n\nAn entertainment station does not generate power, it simply resets the convincing minigame difficulty and **makes the robots speedier**\n\nWell, you got to the end (That's surprising in this day and age) congrats!

Every time you move, you use up a unit of energy.  You can recharge yourself at the recharging station, but you can only move so far before you must return to recharge.\n\nUpon collection of all four batteries, the game moves to the next level, in which the enemies then move twice as far in a turn as the previous level.  There are theoretically infinite levels.\n\n**Controls:**\n\n-On Windows you can use either WASD to move (R restarts from the beginning) or the on-screen buttons.\n\n-On Android you must use the on-screen buttons\n\n**Extra info:**\n\nThis game was programmed using the Corona SDK (which uses Lua for it's coding/scripting language)."},{"id":36842,"event":"jam","name":"POWER!

There will be three pads you can interact with: 1 starts the game, 1 pad activates a forcefield, and 1 pad activates mines. **The mines and forcefield are your greatest defenses, so save them until the end where things get hectic.** Once you start the round stay near the emp tower and **shoot any robots that come near the tower.** Reload often and aim precisely. **Grey robots go for the core, while Red robots go after you.** Kite the red robots if you can and prioritize the grey ones. Once you have a large mass of red robots chasing you go activate the forcefield and it will fry all robots that come into contact with it and ones that are already inside. Activate the mines when there are lots of grey robots coming in, as the mines are set up right in the robot's path. **If you die simply reboot the game and try again until you succeed!** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**-Contributors-**\n\n- **Lead Programmer** - Kryto627\n\n- **Programmer and Artist** - Calemi\n\n- **Programmer and Sound Design** - Flakey\n\n- **Music** - CaptainKray\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCheck out our Youtube channel and Twitter.

So for this Ludum Dare, I wanted to stream the development process for the first time. I also wanted to *finish a game* so I knew I had to keep things super simple. Focus on the mechanics and polishing the game. I also wanted to try to make a game mainly using **visual scripting**. For this I used 2 Unity3D plugins – [FlowCanvas](http://flowcanvas.paradoxnotion.com/) and [NodeCanvas](http://nodecanvas.paradoxnotion.com/). Besides Unity3D I used Aseprite, Rider for C#, Bfxr, and OBS for streaming. I had fun... mostly.\n\nIn the end, I was working too slow. For one, OBS was eating 2 CPU cores for the whole time so my computer was **super laggy**. For two, I discovered that using visual scripting for **everything** is pretty limitting. I'm a lot faster in C#. On the other hand, visual scripting was amazing for the AI behavior tree and small scripts like quitting the game when ESC is pressed. All in all, I managed to **learn a lot** during this Ludum Dare. The game turned out pretty fun but missing depth and replayability. The graphics are very basic (I'm a programmer lol) and I didn't have enough energy to improve the sound system. Next time...\n\nFeel free to check out the videos of the stream to see how I made the game and how I used **visual scripting in Unity3D**.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![2017-07-30_06-55-59_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5652.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-56-14_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5655.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-56-56_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5657.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-57-13_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5658.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-57-27_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/5659.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-57-43_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/565b.png)\n![2017-07-30_06-58-09_PM.png](///raw/f53/8/z/565e.png)"},{"id":33769,"event":"compo","name":"Kit Rocket","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/kit-rocket","authors":["Ethan Kennerly"],"body":"Tap rapidly to propel your rocket.\n\nPost your longest trip in a comment.\n\n16 upgrades for your rocket.\n\nThanks to Jason Denney for brainstorming ideas."},{"id":33957,"event":"jam","name":"Power Idle Clicker","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/power-idle-clicker","authors":["g12345"],"body":"This is a really simple HTML5 / Javascript game I've made on Monday.\n\nIt's a simple idle/clicker game.\n\nClick on the boxes next to the Power Generators to buy them.

Each player has 4 game pieces, which are in the\n\"out\" area when the game starts, and which must be brought into the player's \"home\" row.\nThe rows are arranged in a cross position. They are surrounded and connected with a circle of fields, over\nwhich the game pieces move in clockwise direction. There are 3 fields nearest to each side of the board; the\nleft one is the player's \"start\" field and the middle one leads to the \"home\" row.\nThis means that each game piece enters the circle at the \"start\" field, moves (clockwise) over the board and\nfinally enters the \"home\" row. The first player with all of their pieces in their \"home\" row wins the game.\nThe players throw a die in turn and can advance any of their pieces in the game by the thrown number of dots on the\ndice.\nThrowing a six means, you are allowed to throw the dice again, unless you are out of power. If a piece is on\nthe \"start\" field and there are still pieces in the \"out\" area, it must be moved as soon as possible. If a piece\ncannot be brought into the game then any other piece in the game must be moved by the thrown number, if\nthat is possible. Pay attention that throwing dice continuously without moving is forbidden and by each dice\nthrown you have to make a move.\nEach throw consumes 1 power from your battery. Without charging the battery, you have a maximum option\nto roll 10 dices. Energy can be regathered by either moving over a charging field, or skipping your turn. In\ncase you land on a charging field, you regain 2 energy\nPieces can jump over other pieces, and throw out pieces from other players (into that player's \"out\" area) if\nthey land on them. A player cannot throw out his own pieces though, he can advance further than the last\nfield in the \"home\" row. A player can be thrown out if he is on his \"start\" field.\nIf you choose to charge your battery, you are not allowed to roll the dice that turn.\nParts of the text is quoted from Wikipedia\n\n\n\n##Links \n* Rules http://gamejam.eltanin.uberspace.de/owncloud/index.php/s/vaW5KVdAczJ6f80/download?path=%2Fshantalya_Ludo%20out%20of%20power&files=Ludo%20out%20of%20power%20Rulesv2.pdf\n* Board Part 1 http://gamejam.eltanin.uberspace.de/owncloud/index.php/s/vaW5KVdAczJ6f80/download?path=%2Fshantalya_Ludo%20out%20of%20power&files=Brett1.pdn\n* Board Part 2 http://gamejam.eltanin.uberspace.de/owncloud/index.php/s/vaW5KVdAczJ6f80/download?path=%2Fshantalya_Ludo%20out%20of%20power&files=Brett2.pdn\n* game token mobile phones http://gamejam.eltanin.uberspace.de/owncloud/index.php/s/vaW5KVdAczJ6f80/download?path=%2Fshantalya_Ludo%20out%20of%20power&files=Handy%20bunt.pdn\n* Batteries http://gamejam.eltanin.uberspace.de/owncloud/index.php/s/vaW5KVdAczJ6f80/download?path=%2Fshantalya_Ludo%20out%20of%20power&files=Batterien.pdn\n\n"},{"id":45254,"event":"jam","name":"The Dungeon One","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/the-dungeon-one","authors":["Klassmann"],"body":"![Cover_Itchio.png](///raw/fe0/a/z/72b9.png)\n\nHi!\n\nI'm a Brazilian software developer and I dream to work with game development.\n\n​This is my third try on the Ludum Dare, this time I have made something and I am proud of this. :D\n\nIt is a simple level and the objective is get the key and reach the door, at every step you lose a heart.

Just a few hours before landing on earth the crew of the *Tolerance* realised two robots escaped from the jovian base they just left and hide amidst them. It is vital the crew discovers who the robots are before landing but their efforts are hindered by malfunctions in the oxygen module and they need to maintain it regularly.\n\nPlaytested with 8 players **Everybody breathes** is still enjoyable with more or less but don’t hesitate to tweak the rules accordingly. So grab you printer, a pair of scissors and embark for an epic mission on the *Tolerance* !\n\n\n# Rules Overview\n\nIn **Everybody breathes**, players must discovers who are the robots among them and put them in jail before the *Tolerance* lands on Earth. If the robots are free when the *Tolerance* lands or if the oxygen level in one room reaches 0, the robots wins.\n\nAt the beginning of the game each player receives an envelope containing their role ( human or robot ).\n\nEach turn is divided in two phases : Moving and working.\nDuring the moving phase, one by one, players can move to an adjacent room or stay in the room in which they currently are. \n\nAt the end of this phase, each room of the spaceship looses two oxygen units.\n\nAfter that, one by one, players decide what to do during their working phase. They can either do some maintenance ( hoping to replenish the room oxygen level ) or analyze players in the room ( and possibly discover if there's a robot in the room ).\n\nAt the end of a turn the turn marker is incremented by one. If it was already on six, the game is over, players reveal their role cards and if both robots are in prison, the *Tolerance* crew wins.\n\n### Post Compo tests and tweaks\n\nI playtested the game with 7 players ( 6 humans and only one robot) with minor rules changes that could lead to a more intense game :\n* The game only lasts 5 turns\n* Everybody starts in the break room\n* The oxygen level of a room reaching 0 is not an instant win for robots. It has to be 0 at the beginning of the next turn for them to win. This leaves a last chance for humans to restore a decent oxygen level before suffocating.\n\n# Files\n\nDetailed Rules : https://github.com/KerDelos/Everybody-Breathes/raw/master/EverybodyBreathes_Rules.pdf\nPrint and Play Game : https://github.com/KerDelos/Everybody-Breathes/raw/master/EverybodyBreathes_PNP_Game.pdf\n\n# Credits\n\nGame design : KerDelos\n\nI also wish to thank all the wonderful fellow jammer that helped me test and iterate on the game design.\n"},{"id":43718,"event":"jam","name":"MetaMato","path":"/events/ludum-dare/39/metamato","authors":[],"body":"An average cell phone user simulator.\n\nDecided to replace all audio, large chunk of content and some nice features with bugs!
